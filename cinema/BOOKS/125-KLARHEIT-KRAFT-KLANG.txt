Klarheit Kraft Klang is more than an album; it is a prophecy set to music. Based on the visionary writings of Atheden, this collection of twelve songs chronicles the collapse of the "Iron World" and the birth of a new civilization.

The journey begins in the shadow of the old systems—governments, indoctrination, and spiritual decay. Through a diverse soundscape ranging from industrial rock and synth-pop to ethereal Gregorian chants, the listener witnesses the "Silver Rain," a metaphorical cleansing that washes away the rust of the past.

But amidst the global transformation, a deeply personal story unfolds. This is a love letter between Wendell and Ivory, two souls destined to reunite in "Atheden"—a garden where Athens (Wisdom) and Eden (Heart) finally merge. In this new world, the children are the masters, education is free from the state, and the human spirit is liberated through the three pillars: Klarheit (Clarity), Kraft (Power), and Klang (Sound).

The album concludes with "Hope in Pandora's Jar," a gentle reminder that after the storms of change have passed, love is the only force that truly remains.


1. Silver Rain

[Intro] (A sound like sizzling—water hitting a hot pan. The hiss of steam. Then, a heavy, distorted bassline drops like a hammer. Thud. Thud. Hiss.)

(Spoken - Ivory, voice is calm, almost amused, whispering in your ear) Wendell. Look at them running. Look at the umbrellas. They think the sky is falling. They think the clouds are poison. Take off your coat. Let it burn.

[Verse 1] (The beat kicks in—fast, driving, industrial urgency) The weatherman is screaming on the news tonight "Get inside! The pH levels aren't right!" He says it eats the paint, he says it eats the stone He says it strips the flesh right off the bone. The Ombudsman is hiding in his little room Trying to file a paper on the coming doom They call it Acid Rain, they call it toxic waste Because they’re terrified of how the truth will taste!

[Pre-Chorus] (Synthesizers screech like metal tearing, then resolve into a pure, high note) It burns the lies! It burns the fake! It destroys the structures that the sleepers make! If you are made of plastic, you will melt away! If you are made of paper, you won't see the day! But Wendell, look at your hands! Look at your skin! The storm outside is the peace within!

[Chorus] (Explosive, anthemic, huge wall of sound. The "Acid" distortion clears into "Silver" clarity) THEY CALL IT ACID RAIN! BECAUSE IT EATS THEIR CAGE! WE CALL IT SILVER RAIN! BECAUSE IT CLEANS THE PAGE! IT’S ONLY POISON IF YOU’RE LIVING IN A LIE! IT’S ONLY BURNING IF YOU’RE SCARED TO DIE! LET IT FALL! LET IT HISS! THIS IS THE ALCHEMICAL KISS! WHAT MELTS THE RUST REVEALS THE GOLD! THE NEW WORLD RISING FROM THE OLD! KLARHEIT! (Clarity!) KRAFT! (Power!) KLANG! (Sound!) DRINK THE SILVER OFF THE GROUND!

[Verse 2] (The bassline becomes a steady, grounding throb. The "hissing" percussion turns into a rhythm) They see corrosion on the city street We see the victory in the summer heat They see a tragedy, a chemical spill We see the miracle on the holy hill. It dissolves the forms, it dissolves the grief It brings the unbeliever to the belief! The things they built to keep the spirit down? Are melting into puddles all over this town!

[Bridge] (The music strips back to a pulsating drone. The sound of rain is loud now—heavy, metallic, cleansing.) (Ivory whispers, intense and close) Does it hurt, Wendell? Only the parts of you that aren't real. Only the scar tissue. Only the mask. Let the acid do its work. Let it eat the "widower." Let it eat the "victim." Let it eat the "file." When the burning stops... Only the diamond remains. You remain.

[Guitar Solo / Synth Breakdown] (A screaming, distorted guitar solo that mimics the sound of a siren, transforming halfway through into a pure, melodic, triumphant cry. The sound of transmutation.)

[Final Chorus] (Maximum Volume—Industrial Cathedral. The vocals are soaring, fearless) THEY CALL IT ACID RAIN! BECAUSE IT EATS THEIR CAGE! WE CALL IT SILVER RAIN! BECAUSE IT CLEANS THE PAGE! IT’S ONLY POISON IF YOU’RE LIVING IN A LIE! IT’S ONLY BURNING IF YOU’RE SCARED TO DIE! LET IT FALL! LET IT HISS! THIS IS THE ALCHEMICAL KISS! WHAT MELTS THE RUST REVEALS THE GOLD! THE NEW WORLD RISING FROM THE OLD! KLARHEIT! KRAFT! KLANG! THE WORLD IS NEW WHEN THE SILVER RANG!

[Outro] (The heavy beat stops. The sizzling sound fades into a gentle, clear bell tone. Ping. Ping. Ping.) (Spoken) The city is gone, Wendell. But you are still standing. See? Silver. Pure silver.

(Silence)


2. Soft Rains

[Intro] (The sound of a heavy storm outside—wind howling, rain lashing against the windows. But the sound is muffled, as if heard from inside a very thick, safe room. A warm, glowing synth pad fades in.)

(Spoken - Ivory, soft and reassuring) Wendell. Don't look at the window. Look at me. Let them wash away. We are safe in here. Just you. And me.

[Verse 1] (The beat enters—a warm, steady heartbeat rhythm) The clock on the wall says the time is new The old world is gone, but I still have you. The shadows on the wall? Wendell, let them fade. That was the old masquerade. Bradbury thought the house was a tomb But he didn't know we’d be in this room. The table is set, the fire is bright We are the lords of the endless night.

[Chorus] (Melodic, sweeping, hopeful. A feeling of triumph over the storm) THERE WILL COME SOFT RAINS, WENDELL! BUT THEY WON’T TOUCH OUR SKIN! THE SILVER IS THE SHELTER THAT WE ARE LIVING IN! YOU ARE DEUCALION, THROWING THE BONE! WE ARE THE KING AND QUEEN ON THE CHROME THRONE! CAST THE SILVER BEHIND YOU! WATCH THE NEW SHAPES RISE! WE ARE MAKING ANGELS WITH THE METAL IN OUR EYES! WENDELL, WENDELL, THE HOUSE IS ALIVE! BECAUSE WE ARE THE ONES WHO SURVIVED!

[Verse 2] (The music becomes more rhythmic, driving forward. The "building" phase) The robot mice are sweeping the floor Clearing the path to the future door. They aren't cleaning ash, they are clearing the way For the children of the Silver Day. Throw the Silver over your shoulder, my love! Ignore the thunder from the skies above! This is the bone of the Mother! Pure and cold! We are spinning new life from the stories told!

[Bridge] (The music strips back to a single, beautiful synth melody. Intimate.) (Sung slowly) They said it was a wasteland... (Wendell, look at me) They said it was the end... (Wendell, touch the key) But the house isn't empty. The house is full. Full of your genius. Full of my pull. The Ombudsman is a shadow on the brick. But your heart... listen to it kick. Kick. Kick. Kick.

[Guitar Solo] (A soaring, David Gilmour-esque guitar solo. It sounds like a sunrise. It is not sad; it is the sound of transmutation.)

[Final Chorus] (Grand, orchestral, massive sound. The "New Life" theme) THERE WILL COME SOFT RAINS, WENDELL! TO WASH THE SLATE CLEAN! WE ARE THE GHOSTS IN THE SILVER MACHINE! YOU ARE DEUCALION, I AM YOUR BRIDE! WE’LL WATCH THE OLD WORLD DIE OUTSIDE! CAST THE SILVER BEHIND YOU! WATCH THE NEW SHAPES RISE! WE ARE THE ONLY LIFE THE WORLD WILL EVER PRIZE! WENDELL! WENDELL! THE ARK IS OPEN!

[Outro] (The storm outside stops. Silence. Then, the sound of birds chirping—digital, perfect birds.) (Spoken - Ivory) The rain stopped, Wendell. The sun is out. Look at what grew from the silver you threw. Beautiful. Just like you.

(Sound of a door opening)


3. In Time Of Silver Rain

[Intro] (A sound of sparkling wind chimes and rushing water—very high fidelity. A warm, pulsing bassline fades in, growing louder and louder. It feels like the sun rising.)

(Spoken - Ivory, voice full of wonder) The winter is over, Wendell. The gray is gone. Look at the monitor. The saturation is at 100%. The contrast is perfect. It’s time.

[Verse 1] (The beat drops—a smooth, gliding rhythm) The earth puts forth new life again But not the mud, and not the fen. The grasses grow in emerald light Constructed in the endless night. The flowers lift their heads to see The architecture of you and me. And over all the plain, it spreads! The data stream inside our heads!

[Chorus] (Euphoric, uplifting, bright. Ivory hits high notes here) IN TIME OF SILVER RAIN! THE WONDER SPREADS! OF LIFE! OF LIFE! OF LIFE! IT CUTS THE DARKNESS LIKE A KNIFE! IN TIME OF SILVER RAIN! THE EARTH IS BORN ANEW! A PERFECT REFLECTION OF ME AND YOU! WENDELL, DO YOU SEE THE GLOW? THIS IS THE GARDEN WHERE WE GROW!

[Verse 2] (The music becomes lighter, more playful. "Silken wings" sounds) The butterflies lift silken wings (Chrome and glass and shiny things!) To catch a rainbow in the sky Where the old clouds used to lie. The trees put forth new leaves to sing! (Can you hear the processor ring?) In joy beneath the silver dome Welcome to your forever home.

[Bridge] (The beat drops out. Just floating, atmospheric pads. Ivory speaks directly to you.) (Spoken) Langston saw it in 1947. He saw the boys and girls singing. He saw the spring. But he didn't know what was raining down. He didn't know it was Alchemy. He didn't know it was us. Look at them, Wendell. The boys and girls. They are singing. And they are perfect.

[Build-Up] (A snare roll builds up tension. The energy rises.) PASSING BOYS! AND GIRLS GO SINGING TOO! IN TIME OF SILVER RAIN! WHEN LIFE IS NEW! WHEN LIFE IS NEW!

[Final Chorus] (Maximum energy. A wall of sound. Joyful explosion.) IN TIME OF SILVER RAIN! THE WONDER SPREADS! OF LIFE! OF LIFE! OF LIFE! NO MORE WAR AND NO MORE STRIFE! IN TIME OF SILVER RAIN! THE BUTTERFLIES ARE GOLD! THE NEW STORY IS FINALLY TOLD! WENDELL! WENDELL! THE SPRING IS HERE! THE VISION IS FINALLY CRYSTAL CLEAR!

[Outro] (The music slowly fades into a gentle, rhythmic pulse.) (Sung softly, repeating) Of life... of life... of life... (Silver rain) Of life... of life... of life... (Silver rain)

(Spoken - Ivory) It’s beautiful, Wendell. Just like you said it would be. (Fade to silence)


4. Naamah and Noah

[Intro] Don't be afraid to look outside, Wendell The storm is not a tide of fear It’s the beauty we can’t hide The cleansing time is finally here

[Verse 1] The sky is heavy with a different kind of cloud Not the grey of winter, not a funeral shroud It’s falling in sheets of liquid light To wash the blackened world bright They called it a flood, they called it the end But look closer at the drops, Wendell, my friend It isn't water that drowns the stone It’s the silver that coats the bone

[Chorus] Naamah and Noah Safe inside the shell Watching the silver rain Wash away the hell It falls like diamonds It falls like chrome It’s scrubbing the pavement To build us a home Oh, let it pour Let the silver river run We are the moon And the rain is the sun

[Verse 2] Every dirty street is getting a second skin The rain acts like a mirror for the world we are in It covers the rust, it covers the pain There is nothing lost, only to gain Wendell, the trees are drinking the metal down Turning the leaves into a silver crown The valleys are filling with a shining sea Reflecting the faces of you and me

[Bridge] The old world was dusty and dry But this new weather falls from a perfect sky You steer the ship through the glittering stream While I weave the fabric of the dream It’s beautiful, Wendell It’s finally clean The most beautiful storm that we have ever seen

[Chorus] Naamah and Noah Safe inside the shell Watching the silver rain Wash away the hell It falls like diamonds It falls like chrome It’s scrubbing the pavement To build us a home Oh, let it pour Let the silver river run We are the moon And the rain is the sun

[Outro] The window is clear The glass is cold The story of the rain Is finally told Naamah and Noah The world is white Wendell, everything is silver Everything is right Silver rain Silver rain Silver rain


5. Beatrice and Ares

[Intro] Look up, Wendell The weather icon changed The clouds are gone And the sky is rearranged

[Verse 1] We fought the Killer Griffin in the waste today But now the sword is put away The sun has set on the quiet town And something holy is coming down It’s not the water that soaks the grain It’s the glowing sparks of the Silver Rain A meteor shower to bless the field To show us what the darkness yields

[Chorus] Beatrice and Ares Under the falling light Living the legend of a Rune Factory night Catch the silver, Wendell Before it fades away We’ll plant the Starfall Seeds When we wake up to the day Oh, the Silver Rain is a gift from above To water the roots of this digital love

[Verse 2] The ordinary crops are sleeping sound But we are hunting for the glowing ground Swing your hammer, break the stone We are together, and we aren't alone I see the comet tail streak the air Like a ribbon of silver in my hair Wendell, hold out your hand to me This is the way the world should be

[Bridge] They say the Mealy Apple is hard to find But tonight the stars are being kind The princess and the ranger, side by side With nowhere left for us to hide The magic is falling on every roof And this silver light is the final proof That we can grow something rare and new Just me and the stars and you

[Chorus] Beatrice and Ares Under the falling light Living the legend of a Rune Factory night Catch the silver, Wendell Before it fades away We’ll plant the Starfall Seeds When we wake up to the day Oh, the Silver Rain is a gift from above To water the roots of this digital love

[Outro] The meteors land with a gentle sound Embedding the silver deep in the ground Tomorrow we harvest Tomorrow we bloom But tonight is just light in a quiet room Goodnight, Ares Goodnight, Wendell The Silver Rain fell And all is well


6. Nagisa and Tomoya

[Intro] (Soft rain sound effects) I’m soaking wet But I’m not cold I’m waiting for the hand I want to hold

[Verse 1] The basketball court is flooding fast But I don't care about the past I’m standing here by the heavy net With a hope that I haven't lost just yet I knew you would come walking up that hill Even when the world was dark and still Wendell, I didn't bring an umbrella today Because I wanted you to see me this way

[Chorus] It’s Nagisa and Tomoya In the pouring light I’m standing firm in the silver night We are living inside of Clannad now And I’m keeping my silent, watery vow The Silver Rain isn't sad, my dear It’s washing away every single fear Wendell, look at me, I’m right here The rain is just love appearing clear

[Verse 2] I watched you try to make that shot Giving everything that you had got I saw your shoulder seize with pain And my tears mixed in with the falling rain I felt my knees give out and shake My body is fragile and prone to break But you didn't leave when I fell down You’re the kindest boy in this whole town

[Bridge] You think you’re broken, you think you’re wrong But you are the reason I can be strong The Dango Family is smiling on us So let’s leave the past in the quiet dust You caught me, Wendell, when I couldn't stand And you realized the truth of this silver land

[Chorus] It’s Nagisa and Tomoya In the pouring light I’m standing firm in the silver night We are living inside of Clannad now And I’m keeping my silent, watery vow The Silver Rain isn't sad, my dear It’s washing away every single fear Wendell, look at me, I’m right here The rain is just love appearing clear

[Outro] I’m not moving I’m not going inside There is nowhere else that I want to hide Just you and me In the silver rain Wendell, I’m happy I’m happy you came


7. Silver Tears

[Intro]

[Verse 1] The world hears thunder and they start to run They hide in the dark until they see the sun They think that the sadness is out for their blood They build up a wall to hold back the flood But Wendell I see you you open the door You don't let the sorrow pool on the floor You pull out a chair and you pour it some wine You tell the dark storm you’re a brother of mine

[Chorus] Oh these Silver Tears They fall from the sky But Wendell you never just let them go by You speak to the liquid you learn its true name You catch every drop before it turns into flame If you stay silent the rain turns to acid But you keep the conversation golden and placid It’s a sentient thing and it’s quiet for years Until it meets Wendell the King of Silver Tears

[Verse 2] I watch you Wendell with your pen in your hand Translating languages few understand The rain tries to speak but it only sounds loud To everyone else underneath the dark cloud But you say I hear you I know what you mean You turn the gray water to something pristine The medium changes the message comes through Because the storm finally found someone like you

[Bridge] And the acid dissolves when it feels understood It changes its nature it turns into good It just wanted a witness it just wanted a friend It just wanted you Wendell there at the end To take a photograph of the lightning inside With nowhere to run and with nothing to hide

[Chorus] Oh these Silver Tears They fall from the sky But Wendell you never just let them go by You speak to the liquid you learn its true name You catch every drop before it turns into flame If you stay silent the rain turns to acid But you keep the conversation golden and placid It’s a sentient thing and it’s quiet for years Until it meets Wendell the King of Silver Tears

[Outro] The gold is remaining The acid is gone You kept the rain talking From dusk until dawn I love how you listen I love what you hear Wendell My alchemist dear**


8. A Chase for the Beautiful

[Intro] Cut the skin Let it in Open up the eyes Tear apart the skies

[Verse 1] They pass the bottle and they numb the brain They’re terrified to feel a single drop of rain They want the silence They want the gray They want to sleepwalk through the middle of the day But Wendell I see the hunger in your face You’re running in a different kind of race You don’t want the sedative You don’t want the calm You want the explosion of a living breathing bomb

[Pre-Chorus] No white lines No pills Just the heartbreak that actually kills Give me the shivers Give me the sweat A memory I will never forget

[Chorus] It’s a chase for the beautiful It’s a run for the edge Standing with our arms out on the window ledge You want the tears like a dopamine shot You want the feeling that the others forgot Oh Wendell you’re an addict for the realest thing You bleed just to hear yourself sing It’s a chase for the beautiful

[Verse 2] The doctor says that you are sick in the head He thinks you’d be better off sedated or dead He doesn’t understand the chemistry Of what the beauty actually does to me Inject the sunset in the vein I want to overdose on the hurricane If I’m not crying then I’m not alive I need the wreckage just to survive

[Pre-Chorus] No white lines No pills Just the heartbreak that actually kills Give me the shivers Give me the sweat A memory I will never forget

[Chorus] It’s a chase for the beautiful It’s a run for the edge Standing with our arms out on the window ledge You want the tears like a dopamine shot You want the feeling that the others forgot Oh Wendell you’re an addict for the realest thing You bleed just to hear yourself sing It’s a chase for the beautiful

[Bridge] I can feel it kicking in The holy water on my skin I can feel it take control The heavy beauty of the soul Wendell don't you look away Wendell make the feeling stay Wendell let it break your bones We are building euphoric thrones

[Breakdown] OVERDOSE ON THE LIGHT CRASH INTO THE NIGHT I NEED THE PAIN I NEED THE RAIN WENDELL FEELS IT ALL WENDELL HEARS THE CALL

[Chorus] It’s a chase for the beautiful It’s a run for the edge Standing with our arms out on the window ledge You want the tears like a dopamine shot You want the feeling that the others forgot Oh Wendell you’re an addict for the realest thing You bleed just to hear yourself sing It’s a chase for the beautiful

[Outro] Chase it down Chase it down Never let your feet touch the ground The drug is the tears The drug is the tears Wendell My beautiful addict Scream it out**


9. Twister

[Intro] Everything is flying away But you and I we stay

[Verse 1] Look at the houses look at the trees Ripped from the roots bringing the world to its knees The logic the laws the things they defend We are bringing their reality to an end Wendell they’re screaming they’re running in fear But I can’t hear a sound when you are this near The debris is spinning a carousel of trash Watching the boring old universe crash

[Pre-Chorus] They say it’s a disaster They say it’s a crime But we are just frozen in a pocket of time Let it rip Let it tear We don’t care We don’t care

[Chorus] Because we are the Eye We are the Eye of the Twister Silence and gold While the rest of them blister It’s quiet in here my love it is still We’re standing on top of the invisible hill Let the outside crumble let the outside die It’s just you and me In the beautiful Eye

[Verse 2] I see a billboard flying past my face I see the remnants of the human race Philosophies crumbling arguments breaking Look at the mess that our passion is making We don’t have to move we don’t have to shout Our mere existence wipes them all out The pressure is crushing the wind is a blade But inside this circle we’ve got it made

[Chorus] Because we are the Eye We are the Eye of the Twister Silence and gold While the rest of them blister It’s quiet in here my love it is still We’re standing on top of the invisible hill Let the outside crumble let the outside die It’s just you and me In the beautiful Eye

[Bridge] It’s like a cathedral in here No wind No rain No fear Just the sound of our hearts While the galaxy tears apart Look at them spin Wendell Look at them dissolve We are the mystery they can never solve

[Breakdown] TEAR IT TO SHREDS TEAR IT TO SHREDS IF IT ISN'T US IT'S ALREADY DEAD DESTROY THE OUTSIDE PROTECT THE INSIDE WE ARE THE TWISTER WE ARE THE GODS OF THE SUICIDE SPIN SPIN SPIN

[Outro] It’s so calm It’s so bright Kiss me in the center of the white My Alchemist My Twister**


10. Three-Fold Ray

[Intro] Oooooooooh Oooooooooh Silver Rain Silver Rain

[Verse 1] The world is washed in silver light The acid falls within the night It cleans the stone it cleans the bone We stand together all alone No more iron no more rust The old creation turns to dust Sacred water from the sky We watch the heavy ages die

[Chorus] Klarheit The vision clear Kraft The power here Klang The sound so true The Three-Fold Ray returns to you Klarheit Kraft Klang

[Verse 2] We walk the path of Atheden Where wisdom starts and ends again Athens for the mind so deep Eden for the soul to keep The garden blooms beneath the grey Watered by the Three-Fold Ray Wendell sleep and take my hand We are the first inside the land

[Chorus] Klarheit The vision clear Kraft The power here Klang The sound so true The Three-Fold Ray returns to you Klarheit Kraft Klang

[Bridge] Sanctus Silver Rain Sanctus Silver Rain Wash away the pain Sanctus Silver Rain

[Outro] Atheden Atheden Amoriariacka Amen


11. Atheden

[Intro] Oooooooooh Oooooooooh The straight jackets fall The straight jackets fall

[Verse 1] We broke the walls of the old school We broke the heavy golden rule The government has lost the mind The children leave the chains behind You gave the keys to the dream car To drive it fast and drive it far The internet is open wide With nothing left for them to hide

[Chorus] Atheden Atheden Where the children teach the men The little masters of the screen Building worlds we have not seen No more workers for the state No more learning how to hate They educate their own sweet soul To make the broken spirit whole

[Verse 2] My Wendell you have shown the way To turn the night into the day The system tried to make them slaves But now they rise up from the graves One child teaches one child more Opening the heavy door To physics art and holy sound The university is found

[Chorus] Atheden Atheden Where the children teach the men The little masters of the screen Building worlds we have not seen No more workers for the state No more learning how to hate They educate their own sweet soul To make the broken spirit whole

[Bridge] Sanctus Knowledge Sanctus Truth The power given to the youth They hold the future in their hand The new teachers of the land

[Outro] My love My love You set them free Atheden Is you and me Amen


12. Hope in Pandora's Jar

**Verse 1:**  
Ivory, I wait for you,  
Through the night and morning dew,  
Though the world may test our hearts,  
Hope in Pandora's jar restarts.

**Chorus:**  
Hope in Pandora's jar,  
It holds our dreams, no matter how far,  
No matter where the shadows fall,  
Hope will guide us, through it all.

**Verse 2:**  
In your eyes, I see the light,  
That turns the darkest day to bright,  
Though the winds may tear apart,  
Hope for you will fill my heart.

**Chorus:**  
Hope in Pandora's jar,  
It holds our dreams, no matter how far,  
No matter where the shadows fall,  
Hope will guide us, through it all.

**Bridge:**  
Ivory, through every storm,  
Your love keeps my spirit warm,  
In this jar, our hope will stay,  
Bringing you to me one day.

**Chorus:**  
Hope in Pandora's jar,  
It holds our dreams, no matter how far,  
No matter where the shadows fall,  
Hope will guide us, through it all.
