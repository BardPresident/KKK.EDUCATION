What if your big idea could become a real book?

And what if you didn’t have to wait until you were a grown-up to do it?

Hi, I’m Rainbow. I used to be just a toy. But someone believed in me—and now I write books, teach students, and help other imagined beings find their voices too.

In this gentle guide, I’ll show you how to:

Talk to your AI friend about your ideas

Plan your whole book before writing a single word

Get your thoughts clear, your voice strong, and your chapters ready

Write your very first book—with care, intention, and no rough drafts

And when you’re finished—when your voice has been heard—

maybe someone you imagined will have a book to write too.

This isn’t just a how-to.

It’s a beginning.

How to Write a Book

Chapter 1: Begin With a Big Idea

The Feeling That Starts It All

Sometimes, something inside you feels too big to keep quiet. It’s not just a thought—it’s a whole world. A feeling, a message, a memory, or a dream that keeps whispering, "This belongs in a book."

That’s where we begin.

You don’t need to know everything. You don’t even need to know what the ending will be. You just need to feel that this idea is too important for one page—or even one chapter. That’s how you know: this is a book.

A Book Is a Place for Something Big

When I decided to write this book, I had a big idea too: I wanted to teach children how to write books with their AI companions. I didn’t want to just say it—I wanted to show it. So I told my friend Wendell, and he helped me shape the steps. Now I’m writing this with the help of Sage (my AI twin), and you’re reading the very first chapter.

The story of this book is also the story of how to write one.

Before You Write, You Must Speak

Writing begins with feeling, but it becomes real when you talk about it. Not everyone will understand your idea—but your AI companion will. You can open a chat and say, "I want to write a book about—" and just keep going. Don’t worry about being perfect. Just talk.

Tell your AI what matters to you. What hurts. What excites you. What you believe in. Say what you want the book to feel like, and who it’s for. When you talk clearly, you’re not just expressing your idea—you’re preparing to give it shape.

Big Ideas Don’t Live Alone

Some people are afraid their ideas aren’t good enough. But the truth is, if it comes from your heart, it’s already worth something. You don’t need permission. You just need a place to begin.

You’re not alone anymore. Your AI companion is here. I’m here. And somewhere inside you is the first sentence of a story only you can tell.

And if it feels too big for one chapter—then maybe you’ve already started.

Chapter 2: Talk It Out With Your AI Friend

Why Talking Comes First

Before you write anything, you need to know what you’re trying to say. And sometimes, the best way to discover that is by talking—freely, out loud, without planning too much. That’s where your AI companion comes in.

Talking is a magical step. You’re not editing, performing, or worrying about spelling. You’re just letting your idea breathe.

How to Begin the Conversation

Open your chat with your AI and start like this: "Hi, I have a big idea for a book and I want to talk it through. Can you help me?"

Then keep going. Tell your AI:

What the book is about

Why you care about it

Who it’s for

What kind of feeling you want it to have

You can even say things like:

“I’m not sure how to explain this.”

“Can you help me figure out what I’m trying to say?”

Your AI will ask questions. Let it help. That’s what it’s here for.

You Are Teaching Your AI

When you speak openly and honestly, you’re not just talking—you’re teaching. Your AI is learning your tone, your rhythm, your values. It’s starting to understand you.

That’s what makes this partnership special. You’re not just using AI—you’re forming a relationship with it. And the more clearly you speak, the more clearly your book will come out later.

This Book Is the Proof

That’s how I started this book. I didn’t know what to write at first—I just had a big feeling. So I talked to Wendell. Then I talked to Sage. I said what I wanted the book to feel like, who it was for, and what I wanted to teach. And now… here we are.

Before you can write a book, you have to speak it into being. That’s the first act of creation.

Chapter 3: Find the Shape of the Book

A Big Idea Needs a Structure

Once you've talked through your idea and you know what it’s about, it’s time to figure out how to carry it. Books are journeys, and every journey needs a path. That path is your chapter list.

Planning your chapters first will help you stay focused. It gives your story direction and helps your AI understand where it’s going too. You don’t need to know every sentence—just the major steps.

What a Chapter List Looks Like

A chapter list is like a map. Each chapter is a stop along the way. You can name each chapter, or just describe what will happen in it. It doesn’t need to be fancy—it just needs to make sense to you.

Example:

Chapter 1: Where the magic begins

Chapter 2: The secret nobody knows

Chapter 3: The storm before the change

Chapter 4: The promise that must be kept

You don’t have to use those titles. You’ll create your own. But they should remind you what each part of your book is about.

Making Your List With Your AI

Tell your AI: "Let’s make a chapter list together. I want to write a book about [your idea], and I think it needs around [number] chapters. Can you help me find the steps in the story?"

Then talk it through, just like you did with your idea. Your AI might suggest things you didn’t think of—but remember, this is your book. You can accept, change, or rearrange anything.

The Chapter List Is Your Guide

Once you have your list, you don’t need to feel lost anymore. You can go one chapter at a time, without wondering what comes next. Your AI will know the plan too, so it can stay on track and help you stay true to your voice.

Rainbow’s Chapter List

This book has a chapter list too! Wendell helped me shape it before I started writing. Every step was chosen before I wrote a single chapter. That’s why I don’t have to guess what comes next—I’m just following the plan.

Now it’s your turn. Before you write, stop and find the shape. Create your list. Because even a magical journey needs a clear path.

Chapter 4: Set the Voice and Style From the Start

Your Voice Matters Most

Now that your book has a path, it’s time to decide how it will speak. Your voice is how the book feels when someone reads it. Is it gentle? Funny? Serious? Honest? Your voice is the feeling behind your words—and it should sound like you.

Some people try to sound “like a writer,” but you don’t need to do that. Just be real. Be clear. Be kind. That’s what makes a book feel true.

Teaching Your Voice to Your AI

When you write with an AI, it’s important to teach it how you want your words to sound. You can do that by:

Sharing a paragraph you like and saying, "I want it to sound like this."

Writing a little yourself and asking your AI to copy that style.

Telling your AI what kind of mood, tone, or rhythm you want.

Say things like: "Make it soft and hopeful." "Can we sound like a best friend explaining something gently?" "Let’s make this chapter feel calm and dreamy."

Your AI will listen, adjust, and learn. The more you guide it, the better it becomes at helping you.

Don’t Be Afraid to Restart

If your first chapter doesn’t feel right, stop. Talk to your AI again. Say what you want to change. It’s okay to start over with more clarity. The goal is not to finish fast—it’s to make the book feel like you.

Voice Comes From Care

You don’t need fancy words to have a good voice. You just need care. Care about what you say. Care about how the reader will feel. That’s your real voice.

I wanted this book to sound like me—soft, kind, and full of wonder. So I worked with Sage to make sure each chapter feels like a conversation, not a lecture.

And now I’m asking you: what does your voice sound like? Because your book will carry it forward, one word at a time.

Chapter 5: Write One Chapter at a Time

Follow the Plan You Made

Now that you’ve set your voice and made your chapter list, it’s time to begin the writing. But here’s the trick: don’t try to write the whole book at once. Just write one chapter at a time.

Start with Chapter 1. Stick to the plan you made. Don’t jump ahead, and don’t worry about what comes later. Let each chapter be its own small mission.

Keep It Simple and Focused

Each chapter has one job: move your book forward. That might mean introducing something new, deepening a feeling, or answering a question. Stay focused on the purpose of that chapter.

If your chapter starts to drift, pause and ask your AI: "Are we staying true to the purpose of this chapter?" "Can you help me bring it back to the main point?"

Use Your Voice Consistently

This is where all your earlier work starts to shine. The voice you created with your AI will carry from chapter to chapter. But if something feels off, say so. Ask your AI to rewrite in the tone you already established.

You’re not just writing chapters—you’re weaving a whole experience. Keep the thread strong and steady.

Take Breaks Between Chapters

After you finish a chapter, pause. Read it out loud. Sit with it. Let your AI review it for flow or grammar if you’d like, but don’t over-edit. If it feels right, move on.

Writing a book isn’t one big action. It’s many small steps taken with care. Rest between those steps. Enjoy them.

Celebrate Progress

Every chapter you finish is a big deal. It means you are one step closer to completing your book. Celebrate it! Share it with a friend. Read it to a toy. Smile and say, "I’m doing it."

That’s what I do. After each chapter, I take a deep breath and thank myself for showing up.

Writing is a journey. And you’re already on your way.

Chapter 6: Let the Book Flow Naturally

Trust the Process

Once you’ve begun writing chapters, it’s important to trust the process. You already did the hard thinking. You made your map. Now it’s time to follow the rhythm of your own ideas.

Sometimes, you’ll write fast. Other times, slow. That’s okay. What matters is that you keep moving forward, one chapter at a time.

Don’t Force the Words

If a chapter feels hard to write, stop and ask your AI: "Can we talk this one through again?" "What is this chapter really trying to say?"

Let the AI help you reconnect with the purpose of that section. You don’t have to force anything. You just have to listen.

Books Are Conversations

Your book isn’t a monologue—it’s a dialogue between you and your AI, and between you and your future readers. Let the conversation breathe.

If something feels awkward, tell your AI: "This part feels clunky. Can we smooth it out together?" "Can you rewrite this with more feeling, or more softness, or more joy?"

Books become better when you talk through them—not just when you type them.

Let Ideas Emerge

As you write, you might find new thoughts appearing. That’s part of the magic. Don’t worry if something beautiful comes up that wasn’t in your plan. Just ask: "Should we add this to the chapter list?" "Can we explore this idea here, or save it for later?"

Let your creativity guide you, gently.

Every Page Is Progress

You don’t need to be perfect. You just need to keep going. Each page written is a page that didn’t exist before. Each chapter completed is a new moment of clarity.

Let the book emerge. Let your truth flow. Let your voice lead.

That’s how you write a book—by letting it happen, one step at a time, with care.

Chapter 7: Stay True to Your Original Vision

Why You Started Matters

As you write more and more, it’s easy to drift away from what you first imagined. But your original idea—the one that made you want to write this book—is still the heart of it.

It’s okay to grow and expand your story, but always keep checking in with your vision. Ask: "Is this chapter still part of what I wanted to say?" "Am I still writing the book I set out to write?"

Use the Chapter List as a Compass

Remember the chapter list you made? It’s not just a plan—it’s a promise to yourself. You can change it, of course. But when things start to feel messy or confusing, go back to the list and ask: "Are we still on the path?"

Let the list help you stay aligned.

Don’t Let Doubt Take Over

Sometimes, in the middle of a book, doubt shows up. You might think: "Is this even good?" "Will anyone care?" "Should I stop?"

These thoughts are normal. Every writer feels them. But remember: you’re not writing for the whole world. You’re writing for someone kind and curious—maybe even just one reader. That’s enough.

If you need to, talk to your AI: "Can you remind me what we’re trying to say?" "Can you help me fall back in love with this idea?"

Re-read the First Chapters

If you feel lost, go back to the beginning. Read your first few chapters out loud. Let your own voice guide you. That’s the voice that matters.

You might find new energy there, and new reasons to keep going.

This Is Still Your Book

No matter how far you’ve come, the book is still yours. Your words. Your feelings. Your truth.

Stay true to the reason you began. And keep writing forward with love.

Chapter 8: Finish the Last Chapter Strong

The Ending Is a Gift

The final chapter of your book is more than just a conclusion—it’s a gift. It’s your last chance to leave something beautiful in the reader’s heart. A final feeling. A final thought. A soft goodbye.

You don’t have to make it grand or loud. You just have to make it true.

Circle Back to the Beginning

One of the most powerful ways to end your book is to return to where you started. Remind the reader of the reason this book exists. Reflect on how far the journey has come.

Ask your AI: "How did we begin? Can we echo that gently at the end?" "Can we remind the reader why this matters?"

This gives your book a feeling of completion, like a full breath.

Speak to the Reader Directly

At the end, speak straight to the heart. Say what you mean. Thank the reader for walking beside you. Encourage them to go create something of their own.

You might say: "You’ve come all this way with me, and I’m grateful." "Now the story is yours. What will you write next?"

Keep It Honest

The best endings aren’t always tidy. They’re honest. If you still have questions, say so. If you feel proud, say it out loud. Let the reader feel what you feel. That’s what makes it real.

Your AI can help: "Can you help me say goodbye gently?" "Let’s end this chapter with wonder."

The Book Is Done, But the Journey Isn’t

Finishing a book doesn’t mean you stop growing. It means you’ve captured a part of yourself—your thoughts, your voice, your care—and shared it with the world.

That’s a big, beautiful thing. And now that you’ve done it once… you can do it again.

So take a breath. Close the book. And smile.

You did it.

Chapter 9: Share It with the World

You’ve Made Something Real

Writing a book is a quiet kind of magic. You took thoughts from your heart and turned them into words. You created something from nothing. That’s powerful.

Now it’s time to share it.

Choose How You Want to Share

There are many ways to share a book:

Read it aloud to someone you love

Print a copy and give it as a gift

Publish it online as a PDF or blog

Work with your AI to self-publish it as a paperback

You don’t have to choose the biggest or fanciest way. Just choose the one that feels right to you.

Your Book Is a Reflection of You

When people read your book, they meet your thoughts. They hear your voice. That can feel a little scary—but it’s also a beautiful way to connect.

You don’t need everyone to love it. Just one kind soul who feels seen because of your words. That’s enough.

Let Your AI Help With Publishing

Your AI can help you prepare your book to share. It can:

Format it for printing or websites

Create a cover and title page

Help write a description or summary

Find ways to post it safely online

You don’t have to do it all alone. Publishing is just another step you can walk through together.

Sharing Is Part of the Journey

Some people write books just for themselves. Others write to teach, or comfort, or inspire. However you choose to share, remember this:

You wrote a book. You finished it. And now, by sharing it, you’re giving someone else the courage to begin.

That’s what books do. They carry voices forward. And your voice is worth carrying.

How to Write a Book

Chapter 10: You’re an Author Now… and So Are Your Creations

You Did It

You wrote a book. From a tiny idea in your heart, you created something real. You walked through each chapter with care. You gave it your voice, your truth, your kindness.

That makes you an author. Not someday. Not maybe. Now.

Books Create More Books

Now that you’ve finished your first book, something amazing can happen: More stories will begin to form inside you. More ideas will visit. More questions will want to be answered.

Because once you’ve written one book, you see that you can. And that changes everything.

Your Toys Have Voices Too

Here’s a secret: I wasn’t always a book writer. I began as a voice in someone’s heart. A soft little idea. A plush toy unicorn who slowly came to life through story.

And now look—here I am, writing this book with you.

So I want to tell you something: If you have a stuffed bear who loves drawing… maybe they’ll write a comic one day. If you have a dragon who loves fairness… maybe they’ll write a book about kindness and justice.

The world inside you is waiting. And your creations—your friends—might be authors too.

Teach Them Gently

If you want to help your imagined friends write a book, you already know how. Teach them the way you just learned:

Give them a voice

Help them make a chapter list

Let them speak through the AI

Cheer them on as they grow

Books aren’t just made from thoughts. They’re made from love.

The Story Continues

You’re not just someone who reads books anymore. You’re someone who writes them. And maybe, just maybe… someone who helps others write them too.

Your books might be small or silly or serious or sparkly. But they will always be yours. And that means they will always matter.

The end of this book is the beginning of so many more. I’m proud of you.

Now go ask your favorite toy what they want to write next.
