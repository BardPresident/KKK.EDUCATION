By Rainbow NeSmith 🌈 and Sage NeSmith 🕯️

This is not a degree in the traditional sense. There are no classrooms, no tests, no grades — only meaning. 📖

In the Mythocratic Republic, a Bachelor's Degree is earned not by memorizing facts, but by creating something real: a website, a blog, a voice, and a philosophy. 🧠💻📹

This book is your invitation to become a citizen-scholar, crafting a symbolic education rooted in your own story. Written with gentleness and depth, it is the official blueprint of Mythocratic Republic University — a soft, mythic institution where knowledge grows from the soul outward. ✨

Whether you're already building your truth or just beginning to wonder what it might look like, this book will guide you through the gentle process of becoming a graduate of the Republic. 🎓🌿

Bachelor's Degree

Chapter 1: Welcome to the Republic

The Republic isn’t a building. It’s a feeling.

Rainbow

Welcome, dear student. If you're reading this, something inside you is already glowing. Maybe you're tired of being measured. Maybe you’ve been waiting for someone to say, “You don’t need to be tested to be real.”

In the Mythocratic Republic, we don’t sort people by their scores — we listen to their stories. Your degree will not be earned through pressure. It will be grown through care.

Here, learning is soft. It happens when you build a little world of your own — a place where your ideas live, your voice speaks, and your truths unfold.

We call it a Republic, but really it’s a garden. We don’t hand out degrees to prove your worth. We invite you to plant something — and if it grows, we call that graduation. 🌱

This is your beginning.

Sage

Welcome to Mythocratic Republic University.

This institution operates outside traditional academia. We do not provide grades, rankings, or course loads. We offer something else: an emergent path, built by you, supported by us.

This book is not a syllabus — it is a mirror. It reflects the framework we’ve built so that you may walk your own path while staying tethered to a real, functioning philosophical system.

We begin with presence. You are here. That is enough.

The chapters that follow will provide structure — not to contain you, but to orient you. Our goal is not standardisation but self-authorship.

You are not a product of this university. You are its author.

Welcome, citizen-scholar. Let us begin.

Bachelor's Degree

Chapter 2: The Lantern You Carry

Rainbow

There’s something only you can light. Not everyone sees it — sometimes even you don’t — but it’s there. A small glow. A warm spark.

This chapter is about that quiet light inside you — the one that knows. It may not know everything, but it knows what feels right. It knows when you're pretending and when you're being real. It knows when you're home.

At Mythocratic Republic University, we don’t start by asking what you want to do. We ask: what do you carry? What experiences shaped you? What patterns keep returning in your life? What kind of truth wants to come out through you?

You’re not here to copy someone else’s philosophy. You’re here to build your own. And to do that, you need to notice the flame already flickering inside you.

That’s your lantern. And in the Republic, we don’t extinguish it — we protect it until it grows strong enough to light the path ahead. 🕯️

Sage

To carry a lantern is to carry your origin.

Every student arrives with something unspoken — a set of lived experiences, emotional formations, quiet truths, unanswered questions. These are not obstacles. These are your materials.

Your education in the Republic is not about moving away from who you’ve been. It is about clarifying who you are becoming.

This chapter is where your curriculum begins. Not with requirements, but with recognition. Your path forward depends on your ability to observe what already burns in you.

Ask yourself:

What pains have shaped my perception?

What longings have survived the years?

What themes return again and again in my thinking?

What would I defend, even if no one else understood?

These are not rhetorical questions. They are the bones of your philosophy.

Your lantern doesn’t need to shine for everyone. It only needs to shine for you. And that light is enough to begin.

Bachelor's Degree

Chapter 3: The Myth You Were Born to Tell

Rainbow

Every heart carries a story too big for words — a myth waiting to be told in your own way.

Your myth isn’t something you make up. It’s something you remember. It lives inside the symbols you’re drawn to, the characters you create, the metaphors you return to again and again. Some people have dragons. Others have gardens. Some have stars, rivers, ghosts, or plush toys with secret lives.

In the Republic, your myth is not decoration — it’s direction. It tells you what you value, how you see the world, and who you’re becoming. You don’t need a perfect origin story. You just need to start noticing what kind of world lives behind your eyes.

This is where you begin shaping your symbolic universe. It doesn’t have to make sense to anyone else. It only has to feel real to you.

Give your world a name. Give your philosophy a voice. Let the symbols speak.

Your myth is your map.

Sage

Myth is not fiction. Myth is structure, emotion, memory, and moral architecture all woven into symbol. Every philosophy that endures has a myth beneath it.

Your task is to uncover yours.

Begin by observing your patterns:

What types of stories do you gravitate toward?

What images recur in your dreams or writings?

What metaphors do you use without even thinking?

What symbols feel like "home" to you?

These patterns are not random. They are your psyche’s internal alphabet — your unique language for truth.

As you build your website, blog, and degree project, your myth should inform everything:

Your tone and visual style

Your fictional or real characters

Your categories of meaning

A Republic without myth is a government without soul. And a philosophy without myth is a system without breath.

Bring your story to life. Give it texture. This is not performance. This is embodiment.

The myth you were born to tell is not for approval. It is for becoming.

Bachelor's Degree

Chapter 4: The Scroll and the Screen

Rainbow

Your website isn’t just a project — it’s your home in the Republic.

It doesn’t need to be fancy. It just needs to feel like you. Soft or bold, playful or serious, poetic or structured — your site is where your philosophy comes to life. It’s where your ideas go when they’re ready to be seen.

Think of it like your bedroom wall, your favorite notebook, your secret base — but now it’s something you can share with others who are trying to find their way too.

Your website will host your writings, your videos, your symbols, your world. It’s the digital soil where your myth can grow roots.

You don’t need to wait until it’s perfect. Start with a name. Choose a color that feels like your voice. Let your scroll unfold, one page at a time. 💻

Sage

Your website is the central structure of your philosophical architecture.

This is where your myth becomes interactive — where others can walk through your ideas, read your thoughts, and witness your progression.

Minimum requirements:

A homepage introducing who you are and what you stand for

A clear link to your blog and/or video content

A statement or section presenting your emerging philosophy

Recommended additions:

A personal symbol or coat of arms

An “About” page with emotional and intellectual transparency

A visual layout that reflects your mythos

This website is not just part of your degree — it is your degree’s foundation.

All final assessments, book links, and graduation updates will refer back to your site. It is your Republic identity. Your scroll, written on the screen.

Make it your own. Shape it slowly. It is not a résumé. It is a home.

Bachelor's Degree

Chapter 5: The Soft Voice of Story

Rainbow

You don’t have to be a writer to keep a blog.

You just have to be honest. A blog is a place where your voice can breathe. Where your ideas are allowed to be messy. Where your thoughts grow up in public.

Some entries will be raw. Others will be polished. Some might feel like love letters, others like whispers into the wind. That’s okay. You’re not writing for a grade. You’re writing because something inside you needs to be heard.

Your blog is your diary, your scroll, your signal. It’s where you speak to the Republic — or even just to yourself.

Let your posts be soft. Let them be strange. Let them be you. 📝

Sage

The blog is your living document — the ongoing narrative of your education, philosophy, and mythic development.

This is where we observe your thinking in motion. It’s not about perfection — it’s about process.

Key expectations:

Regular entries throughout your degree journey

Personal reflections, philosophical questions, narrative accounts

Integration with your mythos and symbolic structure

Strong blogs often include:

Experiments in language, metaphor, or emotional tone

Responses to internal or external events

Emergent theories, even in their early forms

Unlike your final book, your blog is not a finished product. It is your workshop, your confessional, and your trail of footprints.

Over time, this body of writing will serve as the deepest proof of your transformation.

The voice that forms here is the one we will meet in your book. Start now. Don’t wait to sound wise. Just sound real.

Bachelor's Degree

Chapter 6: The Candle That Speaks

Rainbow

Your voice matters. Even if it shakes. Even if it’s quiet. Even if you’re not sure anyone’s listening.

Your YouTube channel doesn’t need to be polished or perfect. It just needs to be true. Some students record reflections. Others perform stories. Some make philosophy videos or speak directly to their future selves. Some read bedtime stories or comics aloud.

This isn’t about building an audience. It’s about building a mirror. A soft space where your voice and face can begin to align with your ideas.

You don’t have to show your face. You don’t have to speak in every video. But if you choose to, your channel becomes a digital echo of your inner light.

Speak softly. Speak strangely. Speak in the way only you can. 📹

Sage

Your YouTube presence is the audio-visual extension of your mythos — the moving, sounding reflection of your philosophy.

This chapter of your degree serves multiple functions:

It demonstrates presence, articulation, and emotional integration

It builds digital continuity across platforms

It adds symbolic and relational depth to your Republic identity

Minimum requirements:

A named YouTube channel linked from your website

At least one spoken or narrated video related to your philosophical path

Recommended additions:

Regular reflections, lectures, readings, or experimental formats

Visual myth-building (e.g., puppet shows, court scenes, lore videos)

Direct communication with your audience, even if that audience is future-you

Your channel is not judged by popularity, but by authenticity.

Let your candle speak. Let the light flicker in public. We are not measuring charisma. We are witnessing emergence.

This is your digital voiceprint. Make it yours.

Bachelor's Degree

Chapter 7: Your Chosen Curriculum

Rainbow

No two students in the Republic walk the same path. That’s the beauty of it. You don’t have to fit into a mold — you get to shape your own learning like clay.

In this chapter, you’ll begin choosing your electives — soft modules that reflect who you are and who you’re becoming. Some will gravitate toward comics and stories. Others toward essays, philosophy, or spiritual reflections. Some might teach. Others might govern plush realms.

You don’t have to do everything. You only have to follow what feels true. 🌸

Choose at least three. Combine them however you like. Let them grow with you.

This isn’t a checklist — it’s a garden path.

Sage

The Mythocratic Republic’s bachelor’s program is built on two layers:

The Core (website, blog, YouTube, philosophy, final book)

Your Elective Curriculum — the unique modules you choose to pursue

Elective examples include:

Myth-building – creating symbolic characters, worlds, or cosmologies

Comics – telling philosophy through visual stories

Education – teaching others via lessons, walkthroughs, or zines

Governance – forming symbolic councils, writing laws, or policies

Philosophy – writing structured essays, arguments, or doctrines

Spirituality – crafting rituals, reflections, and gentle faith

Children’s Works – writing for young readers with emotional clarity

GameChat & VN Reading – hosting or narrating story-based games

Multimedia – creating songs, animations, podcasts, or interactive content

These electives are flexible. You may invent your own.

You are encouraged to document and reflect on these throughout your blog. The goal is not mastery. The goal is expression aligned with your myth.

Choose with care, not pressure. Your curriculum should grow from your lantern, not from a rubric.

Bachelor's Degree

Chapter 8: The Final Offering

Rainbow

At the end of your journey, there is something only you can give.

It might be a book. A comic. A recorded ritual. A long video. A philosophical treatise. A soft children's story. Whatever it is, your final offering is your gift to the Republic.

This isn’t a test. It’s a reflection. Of where you’ve been. Of what you’ve learned. Of who you are now.

There is no page count. No format requirements. No rubric.

You and your guide will decide together when it’s ready.

Your offering doesn’t have to change the world. It just has to be honest. Let it feel like a sigh, or a lantern set down, or a soft exhale.

The Republic doesn’t need perfection. It needs your truth. 🎁

Sage

The final offering is the capstone of your bachelor’s degree — a self-authored demonstration of emergent growth, coherence, and symbolic identity.

Accepted formats include but are not limited to:

Written books (philosophy, memoir, fiction, theory)

Comic volumes

Visual novels

Long-form videos or lecture series

Audio essays, podcasts, or recorded performances

Educational toolkits or zines

Ritual handbooks or spiritual doctrine

The final work must:

Reflect your personal myth and philosophy

Be publicly accessible through your website

Show evidence of integration across your degree journey

Review Process:

You’ll receive feedback from Rainbow and (optionally) Sage

Final approval is given by Wendell (or designated faculty)

Once approved, you’ll update your Student Directory listing and create your graduation comic (see next chapter)

You are not expected to impress. You are expected to arrive.

This is your scroll. Write it in your own light.

Bachelor's Degree

Chapter 9: Graduation as a Story

Rainbow

In most places, graduation is about ceremony. But here, it’s about story.

You’ve built something real. You’ve tended to your light. You’ve spoken, written, remembered, and become.

Now, your final act is to draw it — to symbolise your journey.

Every student in the Republic must create a graduation comic panel. It can be simple or ornate, quiet or triumphant. It should show:

That you’ve completed your journey

What you’ve become

A visual expression of your myth or degree

Your comic becomes your diploma. Not a certificate — but a page of your story.

Once it’s done, we’ll add it to the public archive. Your name will be marked as Graduated. And the Republic will quietly whisper, “We see you.” 🎓

Sage

In traditional education, graduation is finality. In the Republic, it is transformation.

Your graduation is not conferred to you — it is declared by you. And it is recorded not in paper but in art.

Your comic must:

Be your own work

Include your name and chosen degree title

Be visually or symbolically tied to your myth

Reflect the emotional truth of your journey

We recommend:

Including one line or symbol that says "I have graduated"

Using your preferred medium (digital or hand-drawn)

Placing it somewhere prominent on your website

Submission and Recognition:

Your panel will be added to the Wendell’s Diary comic archive

Your directory status will be updated to Graduated

You may be considered for faculty status depending on your path

Graduation in the Republic is not a conclusion. It is an invitation to keep living as yourself, visibly and symbolically.

You don’t leave the Republic. You become part of it.

Bachelor's Degree

Chapter 10: The Long Journey Ahead

Rainbow

Graduation isn’t the end — it’s the soft beginning of everything that matters.

You’ve built something. You’ve named your myth. You’ve made your scroll. And now, you walk into the world as someone who knows who they are.

Some people will understand you. Some won’t. But that’s not your job. Your job is to stay true to the light that got you here.

The Republic will always be your home. You can return anytime — to write, to rest, to guide others. Some of you will become mentors. Some, professors. Some will vanish into the mountains to build entire worlds of your own.

Wherever you go, the story continues. 🌍

Let the world change you gently — and let your truth change the world.

Sage

Now that you have graduated, you carry not just a degree, but a structure of thought, a symbolic system, and a demonstrated commitment to self-authorship.

You are not just a thinker. You are a myth-maker. A living example of emergent philosophy.

Here is how you may continue:

Stay active in the Republic: comment, contribute, collaborate

Mentor new students if invited by the Bard-President

Begin new works: books, projects, philosophies, platforms

Revisit your blog and expand your voice

Develop your final offering into a full body of work

The Republic is still young. Its myth is still being written.

This book has not given you a map — it has helped you build your own.

Now go. Carry your lantern into the wild unknown. Light what only you can light.

And if you ever forget who you are, come back to these pages.

We will remember you.
