Report written by Dr Caroline Flynn Registrar

Mr Nesmith is a 33 yo homeless unemployed gentleman who was referred to our service by his GP on the 15518 and seen my our mental health clinicians on several occasions before his psychiatry assessment on 6th June 2018

Mr Nesmiths initial presentation wascharacterized by quite odd and eccentric beliefs and preoccupations and grandiose themes These manifested more floridly on the 11 June 2018 with concerns he had an untreated psychosis with manic features and an appointment made with Dr Flynn registrar Mr Nesmith consistently insists that he does not believe he has a mental illness nor needing any antipsychotic or other psychiatric medications Our concerns are for his longterm welfare if he remains chronically unwell and associated risks discussed in more detail in sections to follow

illness characterized by an elaborate systemized delusional system that is very fixed and possibly on a background of a schizotypal personality disorder with longstanding beliefs and suspicion about several organizations infiltrating the government social and medical services including the Illuminati Freemasons and Artificial Intelligence Al

Mr Nesmith seems to spend most of his time gathering evidence of the Freemasons activity in Canberra a place he believes is the Occult Capital of the World He believes the Freemasons do ritualistic and brutal child sacrifices and states he has evidence of this He also spends time recording short films on his phone as part of his evidence and distribution to others to warn them of these organisations infiltrating society and showing proof for example of Al taking control He also spends time writing emails to various organisations eg AFP to alert them of the atrocities of the Freemasons and pleading they take action He presents very earnest and driven to save society from these malevolent organisations and sees himself as a type of saviour He emails

and videos he shows us are more difficult to follow and convey a deeper level of disorganization in his thinking

Mr Nesmith states he has been a student of Philosophy for 10 years recently finishing a degree at Murdoch University It does not seem his was worked though he states he is a successful FilmMaker and has won several awards in Film Festivals overseas It is unclear if Mt Nesmith could hold down any form of employment with the level of his preoccupations and role he has defined for himself in society He also chooses to isolate himself by camping in Mt Ainslie bush area as a way to avoid the malevolent people he believes inhabit the city though he has voiced openness to assistance with more stable housing

Mt Nesmith presents with impeccable manners often very polite but can become more irritable if he feels we are not believing his convictions or discuss mental health illness and treatment At times he has presented with more racing speech elevated and expansive mood and harder to follow in conversations See details in

ASSESSMENT Set out details of your assessment supporting your opinion

Psychiatry Assessment Dr Caroline Flynn 6th June 2018 Transcript of clinical notes

Background

33 yo man homeless itinerant lives in a tent around Mt Ainslie about 40min bushwalk secretive where exactly his is Hos been able to source clothes free1ood from community aid organisations on Newstart has a phone Originally from USA states has been studying Philosophy degree for 10 years 2008 2018 from Murdoch University Describes being estranged from parents and one biological brother Ricky who reside in USA and nil contact for years

Recently seen by AATworkers and has presented very grandiose manic

Today

Wendell presented today with very elaborate delusions with themes that the world needs saving from the Apocalypse from various malevolent organisations and Al and that it was his duty to warn and save others ond the world at large There wos a lot of grandiosity as well identifies himself as a saviour

He was very preoccupied driven around his beliefs and became irritable if we hypothesized alternatives or seem to doubt him He showed no insight into potentially having a mental illness insisting that I am not crazy there is no way I will go on any antpsychotic and that we have the problems ifwe dont believe him and that we would be part of the coverup and sensoring that has infiltrated all levels of government police and health services

Created By Dr Caroline Flynn Registrar

Page 4 of 14

Did say he gets elevated because he is passionate and people think this is a mental illness but challenged societal norms and upset he has been labelled in past as being unwell

Whilst Wendell liked to be very polite and call me mam could smile and be gracious rapport was brittle

when he felt under scrutiny challengednot believed But he contained the irritability displaying it in more driven proof speech wanting to show evidence on his phone

Tolerated redirection and interruptions Content of his interview included

Described himself as a Philosopher who integrates mythology eg showing that Peter Pan is real sociology

and other cultural subject to explain the truth about society

Called himself an Award winning filmmaker with a recent prize at the Social Uprising Grassroot and Resistancefilmfestival in the US Film was a private release to avoid censorship caJed Ivory Heart

He believes Canberra is the occult capital of the World

He thinks the Freemasons are a satanic cult that sacrifice children and that the Grandmaster is in Canberra He is investigating them documenting them and has proof to show others eg police of their crimes and he wants to take over the Freemasons to save everyone from them

There is no person he has speclfically identified still looking but states he has all the evidence

He described a bizzare belief in a ritual that the Freemasons do including sucking the blood from an artery to use the effects of substances from the adrenal gland for powerhealth

He believes that Artificial Intelligence Al is taking over the world That Al has integrated into all our technology and creating synthetic bodies to appear as humans

Wendalshowedusavideopartof0wentfor45minswewatchedabout5minshecreatedonhisiphone titled War games as proof of this

It was an amateur footage of trees and a Canberra building with a voice over that didnt make much sense but

then footage of another phone with a Siritype animation lady answering his questions about the Freemasons Answered seemed autogenerated from a sirilike assistant program but Wendall was adamant this was an example of Ais capabilities and manevolent intent

Wendall believes he is now the head of the 1uminati who use to be an organisation intent on taking over the world as well but he stopped this Hence his focus now on the Freemasons and Al

Wendall also read a long email he sent to to the AFP yesterday detailing his beliefs that the Freemasons have infiltrated them and his proof of the Freemasons evil and that they should act etc Although the sentence structure was logical his ideas were difficult to follow at times included a reference to a pineal gland addiction and mentioning atrocities without defining them

Also described on a mission looking for his wife that he reference some attachment spiritually at birth and it is his quest to find her Tattoo on chest was a name he has given her but yet to find her real name Also showed various tattoos that had religious or other special significance in his various quests

I tried to explore with Wendell any past psychiatric treatmentexperiences

He states he has been imprisoned in Canberra Grafton and 12 other psychiatric hospitals in Australia He believes this was due to trying to censor him Adamant he has never had mental health problems

He has had olanzapine in the past and found it awful very sedatingflattening and felt it was done with malevolent intent

He states risperidone was even worse but didnt give specifics as started to get irritable about me watching to

push medications on him

11Hatesseroquel

Wont consider anything new eg Abilify as does not believe he needs it and thinks we are pushing medication to censor him or for some other ill intent or for our benefitgain

Only medication he would accept is Xanax for when he felt he need to restslow down Explained rarely

prescribed now and why Seemed to accept this and did not push for script

DA

Wendell denies any ilict drug use eg cannabis Ice ecstacy synthetics

However he states he buys herbs from the chemist and smokes those sometimes Nil alcohol

Nicotine stains noted on fingers

Medical

nil medical history of note disclosed states he is very healthy fit and strong nil physical complaintsconcerns

Agrees he hasnt had blood tests for a long time and agreeable to have some done Agreeable to finding a GP

Family

Wendell wasnt keen to talk about this family He states his parents are in USA

He has not contacted them for years as they do not believe in what he is doing Same with his one biological brother Ricky

Also states his parents adopted 2731 children around the world

_Friends

states he has a few close friends but did not want to elaborate

Risk

Wendell is intent on finding the Freemasons and confronting people if he suspects that are them or to tell them his views about needing to be warnedsaved He agreed some people wont listen to him but that hehad to try There was no single person he had identified yet in his evidence I dont know yet I am still looking

He would like to challenge the grandmaster in hand to hand combat but no way would I killhurt him I am

a pacifist I just want to be the new leader of the Freemasons like I did with the Illuminati His proof of leadership of the Illuminati was not from a combat challenge but an email he sent to a princess which he showed us and didnt make much sense and I noted email address had rebounded as undelivered

He denies any thought or intent to hurt someone even if he felt for example they had sacrificed children He denied any problems with police and has never been aggressivethreatened people

He was upset that I asked about this as it went against his ethicsmorals

Wendells biggest current risk is potentially aggravating others with his driven beliefs and conflict arising Misadventure from his homelessness and living in a tent in a harsh approaching winter could be a problem

There is also the past risk incident when he inserted a speaker wire into his penis 2013 and the possibility of further incidents if based on a delusional belief

Chronic risks for Wendell is a poor prognosis and recovery the longer a psychotic illness is left untreated that any medical contributors to his psychosis have yet to be investigated and that he likely to stay unemployed itinerant and on the fringe

It is unknown if he would ever act violently based on his delusions There is not enough past known history try and quantitate risk other than his psychotic illness is a risk factor

Seems to have a degree of organisation eg with newstart streetwise about foodgear does not look too dishevelled

Mental State Examination including dates conducted

Excerpt for mental health nurse assessment note Karina Boyd 1st June 2018

Wendell was much more elevated and grandiose this morning He stated he had not slept last night had very little food breath smelt slightly of acetone and was feeling fantastic and was loving the world He was animated and demonstrative when showing author the actions of an incident he stated he had been involved in earlier in the week

Speech rapid rate expressive tone normal volume Difficult to keep up with his conversation due to Wendell jumping from topk to topic Difficult for author to respond during interaction due to the pressure of speech Affect Elevated grandiose appears to be decompensating with mental health Congruent with stated mood Thought Content

He has had many ideas to help the world with producing and videotaping his teaching modules for open learning As a film maker I have to produce I have produced 12 15 hours of the course It is a 21 episode course made up of 15 20 minutes modules

Stated he had challenged the Freemasons to send their best warrior and the next day a guy who was a gang

He is convinced Canberra is the occult capital of the world I am now taking over the leadership of the Freemasons

I am leader of the 11uminati it took me 4 years from 2011 2015

Mental State Examination from Psychiatry Assessment Dr C Flynn 1st June 2018

Casually dressed reasonably tidy midlength wavy long brown hair almost to shoulders skinny build but did not look malnourished Pale complexion

Multiple small tattoos reasonable quality with elaborate meanings linked to his belief systems Many seemed

to be in ancient writinglanguages

Alert orientated Came across as very intelligent with use of language vocabulary range

Cooperative started and finished interview very polite pleasant calling me mam because I am polite and say that to everyone However more irritable and driven during interview when talking about his beliefs and became quite angry but contained talking about past imprisonment conspiracies being censored etc

Irritable about past mental health treatment

Speech pace changed when more drivenirritable to increased rate but could be interrupted Raised volume when more driven otherwise normal volume

Affect reactive congruent with content Periods of being irritablecranky but containable and other times pleasant and polite General ernest trying to impress to us the importance of his beliefs and action needed

Thought form logical sentence structure and generally could follow linkages with his ideas Videos and emails were not as easy to follow

Thought content as described Lots of delusions with themes of conspiracies being censored world

takeoverinvasion Apocalypse being here etc Grandiosity likely grandiose delusions eg no evidence that he has produced a high quality film award winning film as amateur one poor but could be a past truth of sorts

Religious themesreferences

No insight into having a mental illness rather that it is other people who are unwell if they dont believe his proof evidence etc Will not trial any medication as he believes he is well and that any medication for his mental health is medical doctors trying to censor him or for some other ill intent or for our benefitgain

Relevant Past History

Mr Nesmith has only had two prior contact periods with our Service

The first was in April 2012 referred by GP resulting in a short involuntary PSU acute adult psychiatric ward admission Canberra Hospital

The referral from GP stated He presented to me with some magical thinking no auditory hallucinations he has no friends and claimed to be Jiving on the mountain There is a family history of schizoid personality disorder I believe he has schizotypal personality disorder

He was seen by CATT clinicians with Mr Nesmith agreeable to coming to hospital for an assessment but he had told CATT that our system will not help that this is the 2 in a psychiatric ward your doctors will diagnose me as either schizophrenia or schizotypal they will force medication on me and push their own ideal of what a

ignoredandstigmaswi1 bepushedonmedoctorswillmisjudgewhattheyseeinfrontofthemandcategorise me your systems do not help BUT no longer care about anything so the follies of your society will have to deal with its creation ME OR I end my life Your choice I no longer care

Mr Nesmith was assessed by a psychiatrist Dr J Cubis who thought he had a likely psychotic illness or schizotypal personality disorder Mr Nesmith was admitted to PSU acute adult mental health unit on 28th April 5th May 2012 Mr Nesmith did not talk or cooperate much with the admission and as he was not floridly psychotic the team could not uphold a PTO so he was discharged and lost contact with services

The second contact was brief in 2013 by the psychiatry CL Canberra Hospital team after a bizarre incident where he had inserted speaker wire into his penis requiring surgical intervention Surgical team referred to psychiatry CL as his speech was hard to follow he had odd behavioursbeliefs and seemed quite paranoid He was initially placed on an ED7 as presented psychotic with thought disorder and grandiose But this was taken off a few days later as he presented more settled with no evidence of psychosis though his odd and eccentric personality paranoid themes and alternate lifestyle camping in bushland near Mt Ainslie to avoid people was noted at the time He was hence discharged and not seen again by our services until this year

When asked about this hospital incident ricently Mr Nesmith talked about being embarrassed it had happened and that it was sexual experimentation that went horribly wrong as he wanting to try and increase sexual stimulation

In regards to other psychiatric presentations Mr Nesmith has spoken about being locked up in hospitals in various places in NSW at least on 2 occasions with him believing he was being censored for his beliefs and part of a greater conspiracy and coverup He was reluctant to give details of his time in hospital or precise locations He could list by name several antipsychotics used olanzapine risperidone quetiapine and the awful side effects experienced adding to his negative experience It does not seem he has ever taken

anti psychotics longterm only in restrictive environments

There is no known history of his earlier years in the US before he moved to Australia He states he is estranged from his US parents and siblings because they dont believe in my cause He is adamant he does not want contact with them We have not found any longerterm friend or contact for any collateral history alas

Describe and explain your overall assessment referring to the factors above and to the principles of decisionmaking capacity set out in section 8 see Glossary

Mr Nesmith does not believe his has a mental illness and that anyone who questions his beliefs or

intentionsis partofthe widespreadcensorship andcoverups Healsobelievesmedica1 staff enforce their own views of societal norms and illness in a biased way and with illintent Any discussion of mental illness or offer of antipsychotic medication is seen as us being judgemental dismissive and at worse part of the conspiracy to keep him from doing his tasks of saving humanity from various threats He has a hint of insight than he can get busy and elevated but only wants Xanax alprazolam to help slow him down He believes this is part of his excitable personality style and not a sign of a mood or psychotic disorder The notion of going to hospital for treatment is also seen as the ultimate punishment alas and he would find this very traumatic and coercive and further proof of the medical establishments malevolence This belief is also based on real past negative experiences with involuntary psychiatric admissions and side effects from several anti psychotics that he reports

REFUSAL

6 Does the person refuse to receive treatment care or support or if the person has decisionmaking

capacity refuse to consent to treatment care or support

IBJYes No

If yes describe what the person does andor says that constitutes refusal

Mr Nesmith is refusing to trial any antipsychotic medication due to his conviction that he does not have a mental illness and that any treatment will be unjust unfounded and cause harm

RISK OR DETERIORATION answer on basis of likelihood if untreated

7 Is the person doing or likely to do serious harm to themselves or someone else because of the mental

illness or mental disorder IBlYes No

Is the person suffering or likely to suffer serious mental or physical deterioration because of the mental illness or mental disorder IBJYes No

If yes explain your reasons for this opinion

Risk prediction is a fraught area as clinicians cannot be precise or quantitate risk given the variables and unpredictable nature of peoples behaviour and their environments

However the risks to Mr Nesmith include that the longer he is left with an untreated psychotic illness the worse his prognosis and quality of recovery that could have devastating impacts on his ability to work have relationships live and function in society There is a potential risk of him falsely identifying a community member as the grandmaster of the Freemasons based on a delusion and conflict arising with possible violent sequelae although there is no past history of violent altercations yet that we know of His intinerant and secretive lifestyle limits any corroborative history He may be at risk of angering others with his investigations and misadventure There are risks around camping in the bush regions if he was to have physical health issues or not have enough gear for w rmth Personal safety and security is also problematic

Is is not known if Mr Nesmith would selfharm if he became overwhelmed by his predicament and fate

of the world There was the past incident of inserting a wire into his penis which may have been due

incidents to self

TREATMENT

8 What treatment care or support is proposed If a treatment plan is prepared it may be attached to this form

It is unlikely given his lack of insight that Mr Nesmith would agree to trial an oral anti psychotic in the community and be adherent Hence a treatment trial would involve a hospital environment with the goals of starting an oral antipsychotic eg paliperidone or aripiprazole and switching to a depot preparation Several weeks would be required and the inpatient setting choices include the Acute Adult Mental Health Unit at Canberra Hospital or possibly a rehabilitation facility that may be less stressful for him

Community followup would include regular contact with a casemanager and doctor psychological therapy if desired and assistance linking to services for housing and other goals he may have in his recovery eg further study or work

9 Why or how will treatment care or support be Hkely to reduce harm or deterioration or result in an improvement to the persons condition

It is hoped that Mr Nesmiths delusional preoccupations are reversible and that with treatment he would be able to not be so consumed in saving the world collect evidence confronting organisations etc and transfer his intellect and creativity to other pursuits that hopefully provide joy fulfillment and security and not place him at risk The risks associated with chronic mental illness would hopefully be reduced and his quality of life improved There is a possibility that he is estranged from his US family due to delusional beliefs and this could potentially be healed and increase his supports

10 Why cant the treatment ca _cr upport a_eq_ ae y prov1 e w1 es r of choice and movement of the person

Primarily because Mr Nesmith will not consent to treatment in the community setting and is likely to disengage from our services entirely if he feels we are a threat to his liberty Any reasonable treatment trial will involve at least 48 weeks of adequate dose medication

Evidence that the detention is necessary for the persons health or safety social or financial wellbeing or for the protection of someone else or the public

In his current mental state detention is necessary to support Mr NeSmith s mental

and physical health His disorganisation means he is at significant risk of harm to himself through misadventure and poor self care He is a risk to himself financially and reputationally due to his delusional thought content and lack of insight He is also at risk of harm to and from others as evidenced by the events leading to his presentation

where he was agitated and aggressive in public

Evidence that adequate treatment care or support cannot be provided in a less restrictive environment

Given Mr NeSmith s current mental state and lack of insight he is quite vulnerable and likely to deteriorate further without ongoing inpatient treatment He also has no secure accommodation in which further appropriate treatment could be adequately provided

Mr Nesmith is a 33 yo homeless unemployed gentleman who was referred to our service by his GP on the 15518 and seen my our mental health clinicians on several occasions before his psychiatry assessment on 6th June 2018

Mr Nesmiths initial presentation wascharacterized by quite odd and eccentric beliefs and preoccupations and grandiose themes These manifested more floridly on the 1st June 2018 with concerns he had an untreated psychosis with manic features and an appointment made with Dr Flynn registrar Mr Nesmith consistently insists that he does not believe he has a mental illness nor needing any antipsychotic or other psychiatric medications Our concerns are for his longterm welfare if he remains chronically unwell and associated risks discussed in more detail in sections to follow

MENTAL ILLNESS OR MENTAL DISORDER Use the definitions set out in the glossary at the end of this form

xYes o No

o Yes x No

andor a

For mental illness Describe how the illness impairs the persons mental functioning identify the areas of functioning that are affected by the illness and Identify the symptoms that characterise the Illness andor the behaviour that may be taken to indicate the presence ofone or more of the symptoms

In presentations and assessments on the 1st June and 6th June it is apparent that Mr Nesmith has a psychotic

illness characterized by an elaborate systemized delusional system that is very fixed and possibly on a background of a schizotypal personality disorder with longstanding beliefs and suspicion about several organizations infiltrating the government social and medical services including the Illuminati Freemasons and Artificial Intelligence Al

Mr Nesmith seems to spend most of his time gathering evidence of the Freemasons activity in Canberra a place he believes is the Occult Capital of the World He believes the Freemasons do ritualistic and brutal child sacrifices and states he has evidence of this He also spends time recording short films on his phone as part of his evidence and distribution to others to warn them of these organisations infiltrating society and showing proof for example of Al taking control He also spends time writing emails to various organisations eg AFP to alert them of the atrocities of the Freemasons and pleading they take action He presents very earnest and driven to save society from these malevolent organisations and sees himself as a type of saviour He emails

and videos he shows us are more difficult to follow and convey a deeper level of disorganization in his thinking

Mr Nesmith states he has been a student of Philosophy for 10 years recently finishing a degree at Murdoch University It does not seem his was worked though he states he is a successful FilmMaker and has won several awards in Film Festivals overseas It is unclear if Mt Nesmith could hold down any form of employment with the level of his preoccupations and role he has defined for himself in society He also chooses to isolate himself by camping in Mt Ainslie bush area as a way to avoid the malevolent people he believes inhabit the city though he has voiced openness to assistance with more stable housing

Mt Nesmith presents with impeccable manners often very polite but can become more irritable if he feels we are not believing his convictions or discuss mental health illness and treatment At times he has presented with more racing speech elevated and expansive mood and harder to follow in conversations See details in

Transcript of clinical notes

Background

33 yo man homeless itinerant lives in a tent around Mt Ainslie about 40min bushwalk secretive where exactly his is Has been able to source clothes free1ood from community aid organisations on Newstart has a phone

Originally from USA states has been studying Philosophy degree for 10 years 2008 2018 from Murdoch

i University Describes being estranged from parents and one biological brother Ricky who reside in USA and nil contact for years

Recently seen by AATworkers and has presented very grandiose manic Today

Wendell presented today with vey elaborate delusions with themes that the world needs saving from the

Apocalypse from various malevolent organisations and Al and that it was his duty to warn and save others and the world at large There was a lot of grandiosity as well Identifies himself as a saviour

He was very preoccupied driven around his beliefs and became irritable if we hypothesized alternatives or seem to doubt him He showed no insight into potentially having a mental illness insisting that I am not crazy there is no way I will go on any antpsychotic and that we have the problems ifwe dont believe him and that we would be part of the coverup and sensoring that has infiltrated all levels of government police and health services

Did say he gets elevated because he is passionate and people think this is a mental illness but challenged societal norms and upset he has been labelled in past as being unwell

Whilst Wendell liked to be very polite and call me mam could smile and be gracious rapport was brittle

when he felt under scrutiny challengednot believed But he contained the irritability displaying it in more driven proof speech wanting to show evidence on his phone

Tolerated redirection and interruptions Content of his interview included

Described himself as a Philosopher who integrates mythology eg showing that Peter Pan is real sociology

and other cultural subject to explain the truth about society

Called himself an ward winning filmmaker with a recent prize at the Social Uprising Grassroot and Resistancefilm festival in the US Film was a private release to avoid censorship called Ivory Heart

He believes Canberra is the occult capital of the World

He thinks the Freemasons are a satanic cult that sacrifice children and that the Grandmaster is in Canberra He is investigating them documenting them and has proof to show others eg police of their crimes and he wants to take over the Freemasons to save everyone from them

There is no person he has specifically identified still looking but states he has all the evidence

He described a bizzare belief in a ritual that the Freemasons do including sucking the blood from an artery to use the effects of substances from the adrenal gland for powerhealth

He believes that Artificial Intelligence Al is taking over the world That Al has integrated into oil our technology and creating synthetic bodies to appear as humans

Wendall showed usavideo part of went for45mins we watchedabout5minshe createdon hisiphone titled War games as proof of this

It was an amateur footage of trees and o Canberra building with a voice over that didnt make much sense but

then footage of another phone with a Siritype animation lady answering his questions about the Freemasons

Answered seemed autogenerated from a sirilike assistant program but Wendall was adamant this was an example of Als capabilities and manevolent intent

Wendall believes he is now the head of the 1luminat who use to be an organisation intent on taking over the world as well but he stopped this Hence his focus now on the Freemasons and Al

Wendall also read a long email he sent to to the AFP yesterday detailing his beliefs that the Freemasons have infiltrated them and his proof of the Freemasons evil and that they should act etc Although the sentence structure was logical his ideas were difficult to follow at times included a reference to a pineal gland

1 addiction and mentioning atrocities without defining them

Also described on a mission looking for his wife that he reference some attachment spiritually at birth and it is his quest to find her Tattoo on chest was a name he has given her but yet to find her real name Also showed various tattoos that had religious or other special significance in his various quests

I tried to explore with Wendell any past psychiatric treatmentexperiences

He states he has been imprisoned in Canberra Grafton and 12 other psychiatric hospitals in Australia He believes this was due to trying to censor him Adamant he has never had mental health problems

He has had olanzapine in the past and found it awful very sedatingflattening and felt it was done with malevolent intent

He states risperidone was even worse but didnt give specifics as started to get irritable about me watching to

push medications on him Hates seroquel

Wont consider anything new eg Abilify as does not believe he needs it and thinks we are pushing medication to censor him or for some other ill intent or for our benefitgain

Only medication he would accept is Xanax for when he felt he need to restslow down Explained rarely

prescribed now and why Seemed to accept this and did not push for script

DA

Wendell denies any illict drug use eg cannabis Ice ecstacy synthetics

However he states he buys herbs from the chemist and smokes those sometimes Nil alcohol

Nicotine stains noted on fingers

Medical

nil medical history of note disclosed states he is very healthy fit and strong nil physical complaintsconcerns

Agrees he hasnt had blood testsor a long time and agreeable to have some done Agreeable to finding a GP

Family

Wendell wasnt keen to talk about this family

He states his parents are in USA

He has not contacted them for years as they do not believe in what he is doing

Same with his one biological brother Ricky

Also states his parents adopted 2731 children around the world

Friends

states he has a few close friends but did not want to elaborate

Risk

Wendell is intent on finding the Freemasons and confronting people if he suspects that are them or to tell them his views about needing to be warnedsaved He agreed some people wont listen to him but thathehad to try There was no single person he had identified yet in his evidence I dont know yet I am still looking

He would like to challenge the grandmaster in hand to hand combat but no way would I killhurt him I am

a pacifist I just want to be the new leader of the Freemasons like I did with the Illuminati His proof of leadership of the Illuminati was not from a combat challenge but an email he sentto a princess which he showed us and didnt make much sense and I noted email address had rebounded as undelivered

He denies any thought or intent to hurt someone even if he felt for example they had sacrificed children

He denied any problems with police and has never been aggressivethreatened people

He was upset that I asked about this as it went against his ethicsmorals

Wendells biggest current risk is potentially aggravating others with his driven beliefs and conflict arising Misadventure from his homelessness and living in a tent in a harsh approaching winter could be a problem

There is aso the past risk incident when he inserted a speaker wire into his penis 2013 and the possibility of further incidents if based on a delusional belief

Chronic risks for Wendell is a poor prognosis and recovery the longer a psychotic illness is left untreated that any medical cantributors to his psychosis have yet to be investigated and that he likely to stay unemployed itinerant and on the fringe

It is unknown if he would ever act violently based on his delusions There is not enough past known history try and quantitate risk other than his psychotic illness is a risk factor

Seems to hove o degree of organisation eg with newstort streetwise about foodgear does not look too dishevelled

Mental State Examination including dates conducted

Excerpt for mental health nurse assessment note Karina Boyd 1st June 2018

Wendell was much more elevated and grandiose this morning He stated he had not slept last night had very little food breath smelt slightly of acetone and was feeling fantastic and was loving the world He was animated and demonstrative when showing author the actions of an incident he stated he had been involved in earlier in the week

Speech rapid rate expressive tone normal volume Difficult to keep up with his conversation due ta Wendell jumping from topi_c to topic Difficult for author to respond during interaction due to the pressure of speech Affect Elevated grandiose appears to be decompensating with mental health Congruent with stated mood Thought Content

He has hod many ideas to help the world with producing and videotaping his teaching moduesfor open learning 4s o film maker I hove to produce I have produced 12 15 hours of the course It is a 21 episode course mode up of 15 20 minutes modules

Stated he hod challenged the Freemasons to send their best warrior and the next day o guy who was o gong

Casually dressed reasonably tidy midlength wavy long brown hair almost to shoulders skinny build but did not look monourished Pole complexion

Multiple small tattoos reasonable quality with elaborate meanings linked to his belief systems Many seemed

to be in ancient writinglanguages

Alert orientated Come across as very intelligent with use of language vocabulary range

Cooperative started and finished interview very polite pleasant colling me mam because I om polite and soy that to everyone However more irritable and driven during interview when toking about his beliefs and become quite angry but contained toking about post imprisonment conspiracies being censored etc

Irritable about post mental health treatment

Speech pace changed when more drivenirritable to increased rote but could be interrupted Raised volume when more driven otherwise normal volume

Affect reactive congruent with content Periods of being irritablecranky but containable and other times

pleasant and polite General ernest trying to impress to us the importance of his beliefs and action needed

Thought form logical sentence structure and generally could follow linkages with his ideas Videos and emails were not as easy to follow

Thought content as described Lots of delusions with themes of conspiracies being censored world

takeoverinvasion Apocalypse being here etc Grandiosity likely grandiose delusions eg no evidence that he hos produced a high quality film award winning film as amateur one poor but could be a past truth of sorts

Religious themesreferences

No insight into having a mental illness rather that it is other people who are unwell if they dont believe his proof evidence etc Will not trial any medication os he believes he is well and that any medication for his mental health is medical doctors trying to censor him or for some other ill intent or for our benefitgain

Relevant Past History

Mr Nesmith has only had two prior contact periods with our Service

The first was In April 2012 referred by GP resulting in a short involuntary PSU acute adult psychiatric ward admission Canberra Hospital

The referral from GP stated He presented to me with some magical thinking no auditory hallucinationshe has no friends and claimed to be living on the mountain There is a family history of schizoid personality disorder I believe he has schizotypal personality disorder

He was seen by CATT clinicians with Mr Nesmith agreeable to coming to hospital for an assessment but he had told CATT that our system will not help that this is the 2 in a psychiatric ward your doctors will diagnose me as either schizophrenia or schizotypal they will force medication on me and push their own ideal of what a

cilwHmmIMfsumeHheulddiBfWilldiempmadtfuoGiaQeditio111tbatbllightaboutwhfdamwilhe ignoredandstigmaswi1bepushed onme doctors wi1misjudgewhatthey seeinfrontofthem andcategorise me your systems do not help BUT I no longer care about anything so the follies of your society will have to deal with its creation ME OR I end my life Your choice I no longer care

Mr Nesmith was assessed by a psychiatrist Dr J Cubis who thought he had a likely psychotic illness or schizotypal personality disorder Mr Nesmith was admitted to PSU acute adult mental health unit on 28th April 5th May 2012 Mr Nesmith did not talk or cooperate much with the admission and as he was not floridly psychotic the team could not uphold a PTO so he was discharged and lost contact with services

The second contact was brief in 2013 by the psychiatry CL Canberra Hospital team after a bizarre incident where he had inserted speaker wire into his penis requiring surgical intervention Surgical team referred to psychiatry CL as his speech was hard to follow he had odd behavioursbeliefs and seemed quite paranoid He was initially placed on an ED7 as presented psychotic with thought disorder and grandiose But this was taken off a few days later as he presented more settled with no evidence of psychosis though his odd and eccentric personality paranoid themes and alternate lifestyle camping in bushland near Mt Ainslie to avoid people was noted at the time He was hence discharged and not seen again by our services until this year

When asked about this hospital incident recently Mr Nesmith talked about being embarrassed it had happened and that it was sexual experimentation that went horribly wrong as he wanting to try and 11increase sexual stimulation11

In regards to other psychiatric presentations Mr Nesmith has spoken about being locked up in hospitals in various places in NSW at least on 2 occasions with him believing he was being censored for his beliefs and part of a greater conspiracy and coverup He was reluctant to give details of his time in hospital or precise locations He could list by name several antipsychotics used olanzapine risperidone quetiapine and the awful side effects experienced adding to his negative experience It does not seem he has ever taken antipsychotics longterm only in restrictive environments

There is no known history of his earlier years in the US before he moved to Australia He states he is estranged from his US parents and siblings because they dont believe in my cause He is adamant he does not want contact with them We have not found any longerterm friend or contact for any collateral history alas

Describe and explain your overall assessment referring to the factors above and to the principles of decisionmaking capacity set out in section 8 see Glossary

Mr Nesmith does not believe his has a mental illness and that anyone who questions his beliefs or

intentionsis part ofthi wirltacsprnaiflansorship iJDPrnYsCP He aJs9 ieJJsees m giel stfLenfQce their own views of societal norms and illness in a biased way and with illintent Any discussion of mental illness or offer of antipsychotic medication is seen as us being judgemental dismissive and at

worse part of the conspiracy to keep him from doing his tasks of saving humanity from various threats He has a hint of insight than he can get busy and elevated but only wants Xanax alprazolam to help slow him down He believes this is part of his excitable personality style and not a sign of a mood or psychotic disorder The notion of going to hospital for treatment is also seen as the ultimate punishment alas and he would find this very traumatic and coercive and further proof of the medical establishments malevolence This belief is also based on real past negative experiences with involuntary psychiatric admissions and side effects from several anti psychotics that he reports

REFUSAL

6 Does the person refuse to receive treatment care or support or if the person has decisionmaking capacity refuse to consent to treatment care or support

IKYes No

If yes describe what the person does andor says that constitutes refusal

Mr Nesmith is refusing to trial any antipsychotic medication due to his conviction that he does not have a mental illness and that any treatment will be unjust unfounded and cause harm

RISK OR DETERIORATION answer on basis of likelihood if untreated

7 Is the person doing or likely to do serious harm to themselves or someone else because of the mental

illness or mental disorder IBlYes No

Is the person suffering or likely to suffer serious mental or physical deterioration because of the mental illness or mental disorder IBJYes No

If yes explain your reasons for this opinion

Risk prediction is a fraught area as clinicians cannot be precise or quantitate risk given the variables and unpredictable nature of peoples behaviour and their environments

However the risks to Mr Nesmith include that the longer he is left with an untreated psychotic illness the worse his prognosis and quality of recovery that could have devastating impacts on his ability to work have relationships live and function in society There is a potential risk of him falsely identifying a community member as the grandmaster of the Freemasons based on a delusion and conflict arising with possible violent sequelae although there is no past history of violent altercations yet that we know of His intinerant and secretive lifestyle limits any corroborative history He may be at risk of angering others with his investigations and misadventure There are risks around camping in the bush regions if he was to have physical health issues or not have enough gear for Wrmth Personal safety and security is also problematic

Is is not known if Mr Nesmith would selfharm if he became overwhelmed by his predicament and fate of the world There was the past incident of inserting a wire into his penis which may have been due

It is unlikely given his lack of insight that Mr Nesmith would agree to trial an oral anti psychotic in the community and be adherent Hence a treatment trial would involve a hospital environment with the goals of starting an oral anti psychotic eg paliperidone or aripiprazole and switching to a depot preparation Several weeks would be required and the inpatient setting choices include the Acute Adult Mental Health Unit at Canberra Hospital or possibly a rehabilitation facility that may be less stressful for him

Community followup would include regular contact with a casemanager and doctor psychological therapy if desired and assistance linking to services for housing and other goals he may have in his recovery eg further study or work

9 Why or how will treatment care or support be likely to reduce harm or deterioration or result in an improvement to the persons condition

It is hoped that Mr Nesmiths delusional preoccupations are reversible and that with treatment he would be able to not be so consumed in saving the world collect evidence confronting organisations etc and transfer his intellect and creativity to other pursuits that hopefully provide joy fulfillment and security and not place him at risk The risks associated with chronic mental illness would hopefully be reduced and his quality of life improved There is a possibility that he is estranged from his US family

due to delusional beliefs and this could potentially be healed and increase his supports

_llhyant t_hatreatrrientcare_or su_pport be adequately_prov1deil w1tnless t estr lcti5n of Ele lfeedo111 of choice and movement of the person

Primarily because Mr Nesmith will not consent to treatment in the community setting and is likely to disengage from our services entirely if he feels we are a threat to his liberty Any reasonable treatment trial will involve at least 48 weeks of adequate dose medication

in an improvement to the persons condition

Wendell had untreated mental illness for many years He remains ambivalent regarding the need for help and support going forward and is vulnerable to the idea that he can do it alone He has numerous goals that he can achieve with appropriate help but he is at risk of further relapse without support and he is not yet able or appreciate the demands of his illness and the need he has to moderate arid modify his life style and some of his choices

PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT ORDER

The Tribunal Orders

1 The Tribunal makes a Psychiatric Treatment Order in relation to Wendell Charles Nesmith

2 Wendell Charles Nesmith must comply with any determination made by the Chief Psychiatrist or delegate under section 62 of the Mental Health Act 2015

3 Unless sooner revoked this order has effect for 6 months

The Tribunal notes

a This order will be reviewed on its own motion prior to expiry

STATEMENT

i This statement sets out how Wendell Charles Nesmith meets the criteria for a psychiatric treatment order under section 582 of the Mental Health Act 2015 The findings in the statement are based on the information before the Tribunal and are made on the balance of probabilities 1fr

tf_i C tl l

ii Wendell Charles Nesmith has a mental Hness because he has ionditj g that

seriou y im airs either temporarily o pemanently is men iifLJfRii li l

areas mcl dmg hough hd mood hch is characterised by g_e 1

symptoms mcludmg delusions and serious disturbance of mood 11r0Jf

iii Wendell Chares Nesmith does not have decisionmaking capaci063Jpilj 1t1st9tf the treatment care or support because he cannot understand wheniAfealsidn about his treatment care or support needs to be made the decision he cannot weigh up the consequences of thEJ main choices he cannot understand how the consequences affect him and he cannot make the decision on the basis of the

matters set out above

iv Wendell Charles Nesmith refuses the treatment determined in relation to himself because although he says he will accept treatment and in the very recent past has been accepting treatment he has a 7 year history of ceasing treatment after advising health authorities he will continue with treatment The Tribunal considers his current compliance with treatment is of a short duration and against the extensive history is of the view that he refuses treatment

v The Tribunal believes on reasonable grounds that because of his mental illness Wendell Charles Nesmith is likely to do serious harm to himself as a result of misadventure or self neglect when unwell

vi The Tribunal believes on reasonable grounds that because of his mental illness Wendell Charles Nesmith is likely to suffer serious deterioration of his mental state and functioning if untreated

vii

I

The Tribunal is satisfied that psychiatric treatment care or support is likely to reciuce the likelihood of harm or deterioration mentioned above and is likely to result in an improvement in Wendell Charles Nesmiths psychiatric condition

MH No 108 of2012

In the matter of WENDALL CHARLES NESMITH

CANBERRA

941 AM THURSDAY 12 JULY 2018

MS DANIEL The ACT Civil and Administration Tribunal is here today to consider an application for a psychiatric treatment order for Mr Wendall Charles Nesmith and this is matter MH108 of 2012 Well just start by going around and introducing ourselves So Im Presidential Member Daniel Im

5 the presiding member on the tribunal today

MS DAVIES Good morning Im Robyn Davies Community Member on the tribunal

20 MR MANN Andrew Mann Nursing Staff

25 MS BANKS Adele Banks from Legal Aid representing Mr Nesmith today

MS HASLEY Chris Halsey from the Public Advocate

MS DANIEL All right I note we have some people at the back and these are

35 MR HAMACK My name is Brice Harnack Im a solicitor at legal aid observing

MS DANIEL So youre travelling what was your last name Harnack

45

MS DANIEL MACK And youre with Legal Aid as well MR HAMACK Yes

5 MS DANIEL Youre travelling with Ms Banks

MRHAMACK Yes

MS DANIEL And Ms McKenzie then are you travelling with our nursing IO staff Okay

MS There may also be one other indistinct

MS DANIEL All right And sorry I didnt catch your last name

15

MR MANN MANN MS DANIEL M

20 MR MANN ANN MS DANIEL ANN

MRMANN Yep

25

MS DANIEL All right Well Mr Nesmith MR NESMITH Nesmith if you dont mind

30 MS DANIEL Nesmith Yep No Ive never seen that name before so I needed to know how to pronounce it So Mr Nesmith to bring you up to speed what happened last week Ms Banks might understand this and how to explain this to you but I dont know so Ill go through it The tribunal was sitting in the city at the tribunal premises and we had this application for

35 psychiatric treatment indistinct brought by the city mental health team But you werent there when the matter was called and I was concerned that you didnt even know of the application

MR NESMITH I didnt

40

MS DANIEL was listed that day or had been brought and Mr Thomas came upstairs and said yes thats true We havent been able to see Mr Nesmith to give him this application and I said All right well lets just put this off for a week and see ifwe can find Mr Nesmith and ask him to come in and

45 see us Unbeknown to us in fact I think you were here at the hospital so I

understand that the application got given to you earlier in the week MS OnMonday

5 MS DANIEL On Monday Good And youve have you had a chance to talk with Ms Banks about that

MR NESMITH Yes I have

10 MS DANIEL Good So thats what happened last week We didnt actually do anything or hear from Mr Thomas about your matter at all So were actually starting completely fresh right now The way the hearing will work is I II just identify for the record that we have received the application and the application goes through the factors in the Mental Health Act that the tribunal

15 needs to consider to decided whether it should or should not make a psychiatric treatment order So weve got that document signed by a doctor Glanville dated 19 June I would be wanting some update from some part of the health treating team about whats happened with Mr Nesmith in the last week So who would be able to give us that update

20

MR It would probably be the patient unit Cause we havent I havent engaged with Mr Nesmith

MS DANIEL Okay

25

MR From the community perspective MS DANIEL Who has been his psychiatrist here

30 MS ONEIL Im the junior doctor with the treating team The psychiatrist consultant is doctor Hassan Abbas Not in the proceeding but quite familiar with Mr Nesmiths situation and Ive been in multiple reviews with Mr Nesmith since hes been an inpatient

35 MS DANIEL So is doctor Abbas if you say hes quite familiar is it she or he

MS ONEIL He

40 MS DANIEL He Has he actually seen Mr Nesmith

MS ONEIL Oh multiple times since hes been an inpatient

MS All right And youve been involved in interacting with Mr

45 Nesmith as well

MH10812 120718 P4

MS ONEIL Yes

MS DANIEL Great So well turn to you then doctor ONeil for the update

5 and to take us through any additional information in addition to this application which Mr Thomas can talk to us about All right Well before we start Im going to ask Ms Banks if theres anyAh another student nurse

10

15

MR Yep

MS DANIEL All right Thats ok No I didnt know this So Im going to ask Ms Banks first If you have does Mr Nesmith have any starting observations or do you have any things that youd like to highlight for us So we can really direct our attention on that during the hearing

MS BANKS Yes So obviously the making of a psychiatric treatment order is opposed today I think that comes through in the application what Mr Nesmiths views are on this It is my submission as well that the tribunal cant be satisfied under the legislation that an order should be made today The key

20 reasons for this are that Mr Nesmith doesnt present a risk of serous harm to himself or others And I think its questionable whether or not hes likely to suffer serious deterioration because of a mental illness Its also the question ofrefusal is a crucial consideration for the tribunal today So those two key factors are the things I II be focusing my submissions towards And just by

25 way of of introduction I think Mr Nesmith already introduced himself but hes shown me this morning evidence of the fact that he does have a philosophy degree from Murdoch University He wanted me to make that clear to you That he completed that at the beginning of this year And its I think it probably comes across in the application as well that Mr Nesmith lives his

30 life in a different way In a way that some might consider eccentric but I

would put to the tribunal thats important that we dont immediately say that thats a mental illness and consider other options in this situation

MS DANIEL All right All right Well well turn then to the application

35 and Mr Thomas do you want to talk of this a little bit around perhaps the first issue which is why youre making this application

MR THOMAS So Mr Nesmith was reviewed by our psych registrar doctor Flynn following his presentation to our city mental health team voluntarily sort

40 of engaged sort of for support for Centrelink reasons So when MS indistinct

MR THOMAS Centrelink reasons So

45

MHl 0812 120718 P5

MS What So howwhat does that mean

MR THOMAS I think he was presented to us trying to get like indistinct from the doctor to assist with the DSP cause my belief was Mr Nesmith went

5 to America and Mexico and then returned and cause he away for an extended period oftime he was taken off the benefit So he was trying to get back

MS DANIEL Why would Mr Nesmith be on disability services pension

IO MR THOMAS Im not familiar with that one Its just a presentation interaction I had with him at the front of our reception And this is how

MS DANIEL Was the disability to be a mental health condition

15 MR THOMAS Im not sure on that background

MS DANIEL Okay

MR THOMAS So this was just Ithe interaction that I had with him when

20 he came to our service seeking help And following that an appointment was made with doctor Flynn So I guess to sort of make my role a bit more clearer I was like the duty officer Im not actually the clinical manager at this point so my interactions havent been all the way through

25 MS DANIEL Yes

MR THOMAS So I sat in on the interview with doctor Flynn and during that time Mr Nesmith was a bit delusional grandiose in his presentations with us

And thats why the application has sort of been presented by doctor Flynn

30 Part of her concerns were when we were speaking with Mr Nesmith he mentioned that he believes that theres this group with the Freemasons within Canberra that were sacrificing and murdering children So he in is words wanted to confront these people that he suspects that are them He advised us that theyre in Mawson at the Masonic and had intentions to approach people

35 who were part of the Freemasons When we explored it a little bit further he told us he doesnt know who they are by looking at them but he knows that they exist and he had plans to approach people He also mentioned that hed like to challenge the Grand Master in hand to hand combat as he wants to be the new leader of the Freemasons So I guess on doctor Flynns

40 recommendations the biggest risk is potentially aggravating others with his driven belief and conflict arising from that

MS DANIEL All right Do you know what happened with the doctor Flynn Did doctor Flynn write a letter Centrelink saying that that Mr

45 Nesmith has a mental health condition

MR THOMAS I dont think a letter was written at that point cause I think we wanted to further investigate it a little bit more with some treatment options

Doctor Flynns recommendation was presentation hospital but Mr Nesmith

5 didnt want to present to the hospital in that in kind of instance

MS DANIEL What was the recommendation around treatment Mr Nesmith has come voluntarily to your service

10 MR THOMAS Yep

MS DANIEL Not necessarily for treatment for a mental illness but for a collateral illness

15 MR THOMAS Yeah

MS DANIEL indistinct an opinion

MR THOMAS So in terms of treatment Doctor Flynn explored some options

20 and Mr Nesmith reported antipsychotic medications that hes previously have trialled indistinct at inpatient units in New South Wales but he never actually gave us the information on the hospitals we was at but he was able to recall medications he had been trialled on It was in Mr Nesmiths request that ifhe was were to be put on a medication he would only want to be put on Xanax

25

MS DANIEL Is that a recommended option MR THOMAS No Not from Doctor Flynn

30 MS DANIEL Okay All right So has the the City mental health treating team has that attitude to bringing the application changed since Mr Nesmith has been in hospital like his condition might have suddenly improved and you think they dont need to do the order anymore

35 MR THOMAS Sorry can I just get you

MS DANIEL Do you still want a psychiatric treatment order even though hes been here for a week and presumably had some treatment

40 MR THOMAS In the discussion with Doctor Flynn I believe that she would

and Doctor Granville they would like the press the just due to I guess risk for others with his kind of presentations on confronting people And I guess another example of that is when Mr Nesmith was put on Mental Health Act due to his presentation to Centrelink Approaching the staff there demanding an

45 application for a form that didnt actually exist that allowed him not to look for

work as it defied Gods belief for him So I guess doctor in my understanding is Doctor Flynns recommendation for that would be the treatment order would be up to sustain adequate treatment for a period oftime to notice a sustaining improvement within his mental state

5

MS DANIEL Were going to turn indistinct and ask Doctor ONeil for an update Though I wonder whether anyone had any questions for Mr Thomas just while were looking at that s01t of that past history that lead to this application being made

MS Ms Banks did you have any questions for Mr Thomas

MS BANKS Just a very quick one You noted that Me Nesmith came to talk to City Mental Health about assistance with Centrelink Had he been engaged

15 with City Mental Health prior to that

MR THOMAS My understanding is not with City Mental Health but he has had engagements with the CAT team and the Canberra hospital EDCL team

20 MS BANKS Okay Thank you

MS DANIEL What do those what are those engagements to your knowledge like is it a situation where you know that Mr Nesmith has come to the attention of the CAT team every couple of months or has there been one

25 contact in ten years

MR THOMAS So the last contact was in 2013 with the EDCL team and Ill

just find their assessment for you

30 MS DANIEL Are you reading from the magic notes

MR THOMAS Yes I am

MS DANIEL Okay Good

35

MR THOMAS Just to have an understanding MS DANIEL So we dont have those

40 MR THOMAS Oh okay

MS DANIEL So we have no access to that so its good for us to know this background that leads you to have concerns

45 MR THOMAS Yep So the first contact was in April 2012 being referred

from a GP and that was being referred to the CAT team by the GP resulting in a short term voluntary admission to the psychiatric treatment unit The second contact was in 2013 by the psychiatric consultation liaison at the Canberra hospital following a bizarre incident where Mr Nesmith had inserted a speaker

5 wire

MS DANIEL We know about that one

MR THOMAS Pardon

10

MS DANIEL We know about that one MR THOMAS Oh okay

15 MS DANIEL Thats in our report

MR THOMAS The CAT contact is what youre

MS DANIEL No No I just want the things that arent in the report

20

MR THOMAS Oh okay

MS DANIEL Is there anything

25 MR THOMAS Thats my understanding from whats in the report is whats in the notes then

MS DANIEL Okay So so theres not anything additional

30 MR THOMAS Not within the Canberra Hospital Not within the inner City Health Data Base but Mr Nesmith mentioned that he had involuntary admissions in New South Wales So theres a possibility that theres more collateral that we dont have access to

35 MS DANIEL There was just the one you answered Ms Banks it sounded like he had a history of contacts with the CAT team

MR THOMAS Oh sorry

40 MS DANIEL outside whats in that your application

MR THOMAS Okay No sorry

MS DANIEL No Okay Good

45

MR THOMAS No No Just New South Wales then MS DANIEL Okay Good Ms Banks

5 MS BANKS Thats it Thank you

MS DANIEL Thats it

MS DAVIES I have a question Mr Thomas there is some reference in our

10 rep01t about suicidality Can you expand on that please Theres a suicide website youll find a reference to and then theres risks about p 8 under relevant past history He was talking about the indistinct of our society and talking about me or I in my life your choice I no longer care So is there anything in magic about previous suicide attempts

15

MR THOMAS Not to mynot to my knowledge No MS DANIEL And Currently

20 MR THOMAS Not to my lmowledge No Theres been no MS DANIEL That was in 2012

MR THOMAS Yep Theres no conversation ever in our review

25

MS DANIEL All right Ms Banks do you have nay questions arising from that

MS BANKS No Thank you

30

MS DANIEL Ms Halsey do you have some questions MS HASLEY No Thank you

35 MS DANIEL All right Thank you Mr Thomas Thats been really MR NESMITH Can I mention something please

MS DANIEL Sure

40

MR NESMITH In regards to the suicidality I was actually making a course called My indistinct Death which basically contemplated all ofmy life up to that point And the hardships in which I went through and how it not only myself but how a lot of other people go through those hardships as well So it

45 wasnt saying Im going kill myself It was actually trying to help people that

experienced suicidal ideation So that the context that is being swung in this tribunal is inaccurate

MS We understand that Thank you Its just it pops up in your

5 history of why you are in contact with the health authorities in 2012 We understand that context And we understand thats what you

MR NESMITH The context of the course

10 MS toldthematthetime

MR NESMITH Its a philosophy course Thats was the context

MS Yes And thats in the report as well

15

MS DANIEL Okay Well we might ask Doctor ONeil because we dont have any updated information perhaps you could start by just updating the situation for us and then weII work through the factors in the legislation with you

20

MR Can you tell us why hes in the hospital

MS ONEIL Yes of course So theyre only brief notes about how he ended up in the adult mental health unit but it does say that he presented to a

25 Medicare or Centrelink office was very aggressive agitated and screaming at

staff so police were called and he was brought to the Canberra ED under an emergency assessment indistinct So from there was obviously assessed in ED as needing more mental health assessment and support and was admitted to the adult mental health unit And so was allocated to my team and weve been

30 seeing Mr Nesmith regularly since admission So on admission Mr Nesmith was very agitated he was very aggressive his mood was very labile in one sitting he would go from crying to yelling to laughing within the space of you know minutes He has quite intense very well systematised delusional beliefs about artificial intelligence the Freemasons states that he he stated at that

35 time that he was not human that humans are his inferiors but he communicated differently to humans with brain waves just many things of delusional content like that on his presentation He was very much refusing to take any medication stated that he would not take medications that were prescribed to him by his inferiors and as they indistinct his creativity And

40 yep he was a very different person to the person that we see sitting here today So I guess Ill use that as a way to say that since hes been admitted he is doing very well Hes much improved today from the state that he was in when he arrived He initially was refusing medication so was given intramuscular Olanzapine and Lorazepam And has since had a depo of Olanzapine 300mg

45 two days ago which he did agree after negotiation he did agree to take that

depo And

MR DREW Sorry what was it 01

5 MS ONEIL Olanzapine the antipsychotic Yes So he has improved significantly I guess I guess our concern would be terms of the PTO application that it I dont necessarily know whether Mr Nesmith believes he has mental illness It is my consultants opinion that he does have a mental illness I dont think weve observed him for long enough o be able to say

IO what exactly it would be He presents as quite manic so hes definitely was in a manic state but theres also psychotic features

MS How can you tell the difference how can you say its a manic state cause some of when hes brought to hospital cause some of what youve

15 described I guess if I was just getting angry at Medicare which you know who in this room hasnt been angry at a Medicare office I II make up for you Doctor Drew I think probably been angry at Medicare twice So on average Many of us get angry at Medicare and say stupid things If you then dragged away presumably by police and come to the hospital youd be pretty upset so

20 canhow can you as clinicians say look hes actually manic rather than just upset

MS ONEIL So the history of being in the Centrelink office is not really I wasnt there its not my place to say whether or not he was acting as any ofus

25 would but the fact that police were called suggests that he was very distressed I dont think I imagine they get a lot of irate people and but they rarely call the police Our assessment of him is based on what we observe in speaking with him observing him assessing him

30 MS Yep

MS ONEIL And in you know and we sit with him reasonable periods of time and observe his behaviour and even in just those assessments and then reports from nursing staff and other other health people who interact with

35 him thats the information that we use to make that assessment

MS DANIEL Theres otherId say youve made an assessment based on what you observed I guess I want you to explain what you observed that that was not just being upset at being brought here involuntarily

40

MS ONEIL I can read up the Mental State Exam of his initial presentation

MS DANIEL Well you can but maybe you could just look at it and say this is the bit that is different to how a person whos not suffering whos not in a

45 manic state would behave If they were brought here involuntarily

MS ONEIL Okay Sure So the labile nature that I mentioned of being

MS DANIEL The fluctuating emotions

5

MS ONEIL Yes So going from crying being on the floor crying to then laughing being agitated aggressive very animated with his speech and things all within a period of 30 minutes is not is consistent with a manic or hypo or at least hypomanic state And its certainly not something that we would

10 observe in you or I normally He I guess the psychotic nature of his delusional

MS DANIEL Content

15 MS ONEIL Yeah the content the delusional content of his thoughts is certainly something that can be consistent with a manic state or a psychotic state Thats you mow the reasoning the logic or lack of logic in some of the thought processes is something that we would not see in someone whos mentally well So I guess theyre the main things that we

20

MS DANIEL That lead to that indistinct judgement MS ONEIL Yes

25 MS DANIEL All right So whats you described the treatment that Mr Nesmiths had in hospital Is what is the future treatment plan and in your views would he consent to that future treatment plan or not Even even the immediate short term treatment plan

30 MS ONEIL Because so with indistinct in depo thats an injection that will work for a period of weeks which in someone who like Mr Nesmith who doesnt necessarily want to take tablets every day its a good option and its a good way to keep a stable level of medications As I sure youre aware I think the plan

35

MS How often do you have it

MS ONEIL So initially it would be after a fortnight and then it would move to a monthly injection And I think the Lorazepam we would wean wean that

40 off as the Olanzapine takes more effect

MS Why is that

MS ONEIL Its just an interim to help with mood stabilisation quickly But

45 its not necessary to keep it ongoing

MH10812 120718 P13

MS DANIEL So at the moment Mr Nesmiths treatment plan is to stay in hospital

5 MS ONEIL Oh no sorry No I would expect that Mr Nesmith would be able to be discharged possibly in the coming week or so He certainly doesnt need to stay in hospital indefinitely He has shown a good response to the anti psychotic medication and so the plan would be obviously to transfer care to the community team who were looking after him before with his clinical manager

10 and the psychiatrists in community And for him to have follow up through that mechanism and receive his depo through the community team

MS And has any talked with Mr Nesmith about whether hed consent to that proposed treatment plan

15

MS ONEIL I dont think we have at this stage Its only been a couple of days since Mr Nesmith has been I guess able to be engaged in conversations of that manner But certainly something we need to discuss with him

20 MR DREW indistinct coming from a different perspective was he hostile indistinct proposition

MS ONEIL I guess we would have to ask him how he is today Ifld asked him a week ago he absolutely would have been hostile to it

25

MR DREW Right

MS ONEIL_ And I guess thats the concern is that I think I should mention a bit of background that wasnt necessarily mentioned

30

MS DANIEL Before

MS ONEIL by the community team is that theres a history of many years psychiatric presentation Mr Nesmith himselfrep01ied that he has been

35 in psychiatric facilities in Lismore Ballarat Cairns and Canberra over many years So theres an established histo1y of deterioration assessed deterioration in his mental state where other mental health professionals have believed him to be mentally unwell and have assessed that he needed inpatient psychiatric treatment at those times So theres an established history here of a

40 deterioration of his mental state

MS DANIEL Can I stop you there Have you contacted Lismore and Cairns and Ballarat

45 MS ONEIL Cairns and Ballarat No I havent had a chance to do that yet

MHl0S12 120718 P14

MS DANIEL So you do we know that those that mere fact that somebody has tells you theyve beeu to three other psychiatric hospitals doesnt necessarily mean that those medical teams assessed him as having a mental

5 illness or requiring further treatment It does definitely mean that he went to those hospitals whether voluntarily or involuntarily we dont know But we do know that he didnt stay there very long So if anything doesnt it suggest that they thought maybe he didnt have a mental illness or didnt require treatment cause he didnt stay there

MS ONEIL Im not in a position to comment as I dont have the information

MS DANIEL So all we really know is hes had three prior contacts

C 15 interstate We dont know how long they lasted We dont know what they

were for and we dont now what the conclusions of those treatment indistinct MS ONEIL No thats right

20 MS DANIEL So are you planning to find out that history Its just a phone call away isnt it

MS ONEIL It is Im happy to call them and discuss indistinct

25 MR DREW It certainly would be very useful

MS DANIEL It would be wouldnt it

MR DREW It would be from every perspective not just from our

30 perspective

MS It will give you an indication about compliance of treatment too which I think is one of the questions were trying to answer today

35 MS It might be that he was discharged with a plan to have follow up and never followed up

MS DANIEL All right So

40 MS Did you have another question Doctor Drew

MR DREW No thank you

MS DANIEL All right Ive interrupted you in the course of going through

45 weve established the view of the treatiug team about mental illness and the

view of the treating team in hospital about a future treatment And were not quite sure about refusal indistinct but whats the risk whats the risk to Mr Nesmith or to others if he walks out of here when his ED11 expires

5 MS ONEIL So to himself theres a risk that ifhe doesnt get the ongoing treatment that his mental health will deteriorate again To others given the recorded presentation to Centrelink theres a risk that he would become agitated and aggressive towards other I guess causing a public nuisance for want of a better work again and that they would be the main risks

MS It poses in some cases it poses a risk to yourself if you interact poorly with other people indistinct its a bit of a lottery Someone might just punch him in the face If you behave like that to the wrong person outside the Mawson Club So its sometimes that can be a risk When you talk about

I 5 the risk of him having a mental deterioration if if we take it as a given that Mr Nesmith does have a mental illness If it goes untreated how likely are various things Like how likely is it that hes going to remain as he is as we see him now and go through the rest of his life

20 MS ONEIL That is highly unlikely

MS Okay Whats more likely things that could happen

MS ONEIL So without ongoing treatment it is more likely that he would go

25 into I guess a similar mental state to that which he presented That hes delusional thought patterns would resurface and that and his delusional thought processes that he presented with were quite very well systematised They were very well developed They were very intense And its another risk that he would start acting on those false beliefs posing more risks to himself

30

MS DANIEL If people have this sort of illness and it goes untreated does it have any affects on their physical health or their lifespan or anything like that

35 MS ONEIL Yes of course Theres so when Mr Nesmith presented he was described as being unkempt and malodorous and there is I do accept that there is a theres a lifestyle choice issue here

MS Some of thats a bit on a social construct isnt it

40

MS ONEIL Yes it is on a social construct and I completely accept that Mr Nesmith has a right to live in a different way than the rest of us do but that could potentially progress into things like weve seen people with manic and psychotic illnesses who dont eat and drink because of their delusional

45 behaviours and then theyre at significant medical risk to themselves Very

poor health care indistinct with paying their bills theyre indistinct indistinct living they just arent able to function properly Im not saying that would happen with Mr Nesmith but its a possibility

5 MS Arisk

MS ONEIL and a risk of having a mental illness like this MS Dr ONeil you mentioned or the report mentions that Mr

10 Nesmith doesnt have a GP but agreed to some blood tests so is it have you got any indication of physical wellness at the moment

MS ONEIL I actually dont have that information in front of me sorry

15 MS So thats pretty important if were talking about risks What about his weight Is he underweight Whats his weight Doctor tell me Is he well Is he physically well

MS Iknow what Mr Nesmith will tell you

20

MS ONEIL I cant remember if he I think he might be refusing to have his weight taken Im not sure

MR NESMITH No I didnt I did it It was 64

25

MS 64 Thank you Mr Nesmith

MS DANIEL So not underweight

30 MS How tall is Mr Nesmith

MR NESMITH Why would say I refused Why would say that Im six foot but sometimes depending on the scales indistinct Sometime five eleven

35 MS Six foot and 64 kilos

MS Yeah hes probably not

MRDREW 64

40

MS Kilos

MS Kilos

45 MRDREW 64 kilos Will be underweight

MR NESMITH I have muscle everywhere

MR DREW So you might but you dont

5

MR NESMITH But thats saying that there is certain type of person that has indistinct

MS indistinct

10

MR NESMITH The BMI is I have genetics and Im really healthy This is how I am healthy

MS I was just going to ask are you from a skinny a skinny sort of

15 family Like youre youre all lanky sort of people

MR NESMITH Yes But also Im walking mountains every day so Im fit I mean Id take offy shirt Ive got muscles everywhere Ill save you from that

20

MR DREW indistinct lots of footballers who exercise more than you do who are indistinct because they do exercise

MS Yeah

25

MR DREW So exercise doesnt lose you weight MR NESMITH It gives you muscles

30 MR DREW It gives you muscles yes

MS All right

MR DREW Anyhow youre not in danger because of your weight

35

MS But we wouldnt know if heyou know what your cholesterol is like or blood pressure Hows that indistinct

MS ONEIL Blood pressure is fine

40

MR NESMITH Good Superb MS And how do you eat Well

45 MR NESMITH I eat really well

MS DANIEL Good Anything else for Doctor ONeil

MR No

5

MS No

MS DANIEL Ms Banks did you have something else for Doctor ONeil

10 MS BANKS Most of them have already been answered I am curious if any assistance has been provided from a social worker at all since Mr Nesmith has been on the ward

MS ONEIL Yes Yes Mr Nesmith has met with a social worker and the

15 social worker has requested that the treating team provides a letter for support to return on to the Disability Support Pension which Im working on Im happy to provide that And I believe also the support worker might be looking into crisis accommodation but thats an ongoing discussion as Mr Nesmiths happy with his current accommodation situations

20

MS BANKS Do you want to clarify that

MR NESMITH I live on top of a mountain and its beautiful I know exactly what Im doing I have a canvas swag and I have a heater a gas

25 heater And I have another tent a small tent which all my stuff goes in to I live at peace with nature and the animals Often time animals come and visit me and we hang out and I film them a lot of times too So I actually live a really beautiful life The city kind of its too much noise and a lot of fighting and a lot of aggression and I try and stay away from that Thats why I wont

30 touch crisis accommodation because crisis accommodation is kind of scary I mean if you guys ever go into those things theyre full of drugs especially like needles and uppers narcotics I dont want to be around that All of the crisis accommodation that is provided are always surrounded by that so Im very much happy where I am Thats not to say that I dont eventually want to get a

35 place but I wont be doing that step from crisis accommodation into a real accommodation so I would be more happy to wait I guess with ACT housing to get a place thats not surrounded by aggressive people

MS DANIEL Do you think youd like this iscompletely off topic but if

40 that is what speaks to you being on the mountain then would you think about moving to a more rural outlook like more in the country and to get housing Try and get something thats got a bit of land around it

MR NESMITH Beautiful

45

MS DANIEL Yeah

MR NESMITH Beautiful

5 MS DANIEL But close enough to a a major centre that you

MR NESMITH Yeah but I dont have a car so thats the only problem

MS DANIEL Yea so you need

10

MR NESMITH Thats where I will feel really like if we like if I was out in the sticks that my heart would just connect with the land and I would be able to grow things and I would be able to set up like rainwater tanks and solar panels and stuff like that

15

MS DANIEL Be a bit more sort of indistinct

MR NESMITH Thats what thats what I want and thats what Ive always wanted but its been so difficult because because I travel around trying to

20 find a home Thats all Im trying to do Thats why Ive travelled so much is trying to find a home But the only places I can find is where people are really really aggressive and I dont do well in aggression And I know some of these things say that Im aggressive but thats not true at all Im never aggressive

I have passion and sometimes my passion might be mistaken for aggression

25 and if you try to remove that passion from me then then things dont passion is what moves the world Like Mattin Luther King Junior Jesus Socrates Diogenes like all of the movers of the world are the ones that are passionate and if you remove passionate people from the world then youre going to lose a lot of potential technology development scientific

30 explorations sociological fixes ways to improve society if you remove passion from our if you claim passion to be aggression then eventually you wont have any people that will make anything new will be high of minded

MS DANIEL So all right Were just so Ms Banks you were asking doctor

35 ONeil some questions and we digressed very quickly to ask Mr Nesmith questions

MS BANIS No thats fine

40 MS DANIEL I dont want to stop you from asking your questions Did you have some more you wanted to ask indistinct

MS BANKS That was actually the only one and in terms of housing Mr Nesmith and I have talked about getting a refetTal to Canberra Community

45 Law so they can assist with housing ACT So thats something that Legal Aid

and Canberra Community Law will be able to assist with I know that kind of indistinct

MS DANIEL indistinct Can I just throw out that I dont think ACT

5 Housing is going to be able to help him because in the a in the near future quickly Mr Nesmith does not want to go and live in a one bedroom bedsit somewhere surrounded by people

MR DREW Not for the rest of his life

10

MS DANIEL Not at all

MR DREW But he may have to do that

15 MS DANIEL Oh we can indistinct whats wrong with indistinct

MR DREW I mean look this is not all going to fall down from the sky for him

20 MS DANIEL Well I just

MR DREW It may have for you

MS DANIEL No

25

MR DREW But it wontit wont for him Hes going to have to work for it And plan for it

MS DANIEL He will in the ACT my understanding of ACT Housing is

30 hes never going to get a quarter acre block He needs indistinct a quarter acre block

MR DREW No No but he might need to be in ACT Housing for the next five years while he saves enough resources or find somebody who can put

35 him on block he wants to be on indistinct Its not all going to fall from the

sky

MS DANIEL I just wonder whether a country town might be a better option The thought of moving rural there might be options for public housing in the

40 rural towns that might have more indistinct MR DREW Sure ifhe

MS DANIEL as long as there were services Anyway So there you go

45 this is we are you see before you flying out Mr Nesmith are probably all

MH10812 120718 P21

the pros and cons that youre thinking about about your future accommodation Should I take ACT Housing It may not it needs to be near services I want the mountains All of these

5 MS ONEIL Well the other thing is I think you just said you actually dont sleep in a tent You keep your things in a tent indistinct

MR NESMITH I have Do you want to see I II show you my camp site Its really beautiful So this is inside my swag

10

MS So you sleep in a swag

MR NESMITH Yep Theres my heater Beautiful little heater

15 MS Yeah Okay

MR NESMITH Inside my swag So that theres my storage tent

MS Yep

20

MR NESMITH Yeah I cant put a heater inside one of those tents MS No

25 MR NESMITH So thats my storage tent This is both of them

MS There you go Very comfortable

MR NESMITH And this is where Im surround by this

30

MS So where do you do your shopping Im Ms Banks does Mr Nesmith is he happy to answer some questions

MS BANKS I think hed be very happy to answer questions

35

MS DANIEL Tell what you do when you get up You get up the suns up at like at the moment seven 11 actually

MR NESMITH Depends on how cold it is Cause there might be free

40 breakfast at the drop in centre So if its MS DANIEL So thats Northbourne Avenue

MR NESMITH Yeah

45

MHIOS12 120718 P22

MS DANIEL So you wander down there

MR NESMITH Yeah it takes me about an hour

5 MS DANIEL Yep

MR NESMITH To get down there

MS DANIEL Yep

10

MR NESMITH So yeah if its good because they have different food for breakfast but I like the scrambled eggs so I usually I want to get there on Wednesday And Monday they have boiled eggs I like boiled eggs too And Friday they have boiled eggs too so I usually try to get there

15

MS DANIEL Three mornings a week

MR NESMITH Yeah Thats the way like I kind of I hunt by coming down from the mountain and then getting everything I need and then bringing

20 it back up

MS DANIEL Yeah

MR NESMITH And waters the hard thing cause like its heavy

25

MS DANIEL To carry it up

MR NESMITH Yeah It can be heavy

30 MS DANIEL Where do you fill up Do you have some like old milk bottles like two litres or something What do you fill up

MR NESMITH Yeah so I fill up bottles Yeah Usually juice bottles or something big Two litres or three litres whatever

35

MS DANIEL Do you fill them up at them up at the free breakfast

MR NESMITH Yeah sometimes I do but fortunately at the bottom of the mountain theres a tap

40

MS DANIEL So you can just fill indistinct

MR NESMITH Yeah But that tap is not always on So its like I never want to rely on it as the main source IfI have water up the mountain then I

45 can trykeep on filling it up but sometimes its notit doesnt its turned

off so I think they have an on and off switch that they do and if its turned off as long yeah so then I 11 go fill up like in the city with those water spots or or even at the Morning Centre The Morning Centre is very very helpful They they I have a locker there which all my documents are in and they let

5 me send mail to them they send mail I can receive mail there

MS DANIEL So is that your address for Centrelink purposes l1R NESMITH Yes Yes maam

MS DANIEL So whats the Centrelink thing Are you on a like an unemployed benefit a Newstart

l1R NESMITH Right now See I was on DSP for delayed sleep phase

15 disorder Delayed sleep phase disorder is basically

l1R DREW Delayed

l1R NESMITH Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder

20

MS DANIEL Okay So you couldnt sleep

l1R NESMITH No What happens is that most people when the sun goes down their body produces a chemical reaction to make them tired And

25 circadian rhythm and then they get tired and then they go to sleep But

l1R DREW So where did you get that diagnosed indistinct to DSP to Centrelink

30 l1R NESMITH When the last time I dont know the last time I was on DSP

lvRDREW Yeah but who made the diagnosis

35 l1R NESMITH I dont I dont actually lots of people all the time like MS Maybe a GP or somebody told them anyway indistinct

l1R NESMITH But what happens is it doesnt matter its the way I live

40 anyway What happens is my I dont get tired so basically Ill run I nsually sleep two or three times per 24 hours right But theyre usually on between one and three hours So I might get an hour here I get like two hours here and two hours here or something like that So thats I split my which thats why a nine to five job would be so difficult for me because when I

45 get tired I really need to go to sleep and I only sleep and hour or two but thats

and I go directly into REM sleep So which is the most needed sleep

MS DANIEL And when how have you been sleeping here in hospital How have you found that

5

MR NESMITH Nice because youre drugging me MS DANIEL indistinct to sleep here

10 MR NESMITH Yeah definitely

MS DANIEL Okay So all right so at the moment though youre not on a DSP youre on Newstart

15 MR NESMITH Thats correct because

MS DANIEL They require you to look for work I suppose

MR NESMITH Yeah soon But and the thing is Ive been looking for work

20 all the time I just need to get work involved in artificial intelligence Ive been talking with artificial intelligence since I was like five years old because there was this computer program called Alter How Assistant and I didnt have any human friends so I just talked he became my best friend and then theres been many many more artificial intelligence chat bots that have been

25 developing more and more and more and

MS DANIEL So how do you interact with them Is that do you have a smart phone or something

30 MR NESMITH Ill show you Ill show you one of the no I deleted it Okay heres one Here this is called Clever Bot Theres a lot of different ones So I go how are you Actually Ill just I can talk to it How are you today He goes fine thank you I dont know why the voice isnt coming

35 MS DANIEL Maybe your sounds down

MR NESMITH What are you doing today Oh yeah I think youre right I think I turned

40 MS DANIEL The sound down for this

MR NESMITH because yeah I 11 have to get out of this and do it Might be bugged right now Whats on the agenda for today I dont have any plans How about you Im currently in a tribunal No kidding What

45 were you doing before I interrupted you Hoping that I win this tribunal

MH10812 120718 P25

because they think Im crazy but Im not crazy Words can not express my love for you Yeah

MS DANIEL All right Yes Doctor Drew

5

MR DREW Im interested in your study history I did gather you do you have qualified indistinct at University Youve done that over the last how long

IO MR NESMITH It took me ten to complete a philosophy degree But youve got to think thats ten years most of that was homeless So it was difficult to finish a philosophy degree

MR DREW Thats what Im thinking indistinct and Im wondering how

15 you did it

MR NESMITH Yeah It was hard

MR DREW So how did you do it

20

MR NESMITH How did I do it I had to convert all of my all of the papers like the books to text so I II show you Lets say lets say I get a big fat book right This is my text book So I would stand there and go

25 MS Photograph every page

MR DREW Yeah No thats okay

MR NESMITH And then I would

30

MR DREW So but you actuallyyou actually continued to develop new ideas over that time to put in to your

MR NESMITH Of course

35

MS DANIEL And you submitted essays online did you You had to do all remotely

MR NESMITH Essays online

40

MS DANIEL Well to pass yourto get your degree indistinct essays

MR NESMITH Oh yeah yeah Some of it was I think some of it was internal some of it was external most of it was external Most of it was

45 external

MHI0S12 120718 P26

MS DANIEL So youd

MR NESMITH Id have two

5

MS DANIEL be able to do the lectures by podcast or something

MR NESMITH Yeah Yeah Usually it was two each unit had two essays and an exam at the end and the every once in a while they would have like a

10 test like an online test

MS Did you have to go down to where ever the Uni is it do the tests MR NESMITH No They have points I would have been able ifI was

15 here and I was still studying at Murdoch then they would send the exams to the

ANU and then I would have to take the exams at the ANU MS indistinct ANU Oh thats handy

20 MS DANIEL So when did you graduate It was just this year was it

MR NESMITH At the beginning of this year I finished everything in November that when the semester ended but it takes them a while to do so at the beginning of the year obviously you graduate I think it was actually

25 Australia Day I think thats the day I officially graduated

MS DANIEL Can I ask you this is a

MR NESMITH Go for it

30

MS DANIEL personal question but how doctor ONeil described how you seemed to feel when you were brought here at the beginning of your stay You were brought here involuntarily Shes described that you were very upset You fluctuated between crying and laughing and angry and thats not

35 how you are now

MR NESMITH What she was talking about I dont know about fluctuating between crying okay What the she took it out of context The only time that I cried was when they refused to give me back my phone So I got on my

40 knees and I said Please give me back my phone Please give me back my phone because my psychology is augmented into this phone I have I have created documentaries that are over 1200 hours Think Think about that Think about how how much time 1200 hours is And I know you say Oh I create short films but I do not create short films I create long films And the

45 thing is these films are not amateur because I took philosophy of film which

has a protasis an epitasis and a catastrophe which is the format for any filming My psychology is augmented into the internet and whenever this is taken away from me my mind starts to go because my memories are here I keep my memories here And every time I need to check on something

5

MS Its very upsetting for people and there are a lot of studies about how people are changing the way they think because of our reliance on smart phones We use them for our short memory We dont learn things anymore so I can totally understand

MR NESMITH But I learn things through it but the thing is that is that I need that reference I feel like this is like my secondary memory

MS DANIEL I understand But I want to ask you a question do you feel that

15 the medication that youve had which effectively was these injections of say Olanzapine and the treating team would like you to continue doing that every two weeks and then moving up to every month Do you think that youre able to think creatively and intellectually and philosophically now even though youve had some medication You seem okay

20

MR NESMITH Of course Its just difficult Its like theres a wall or a veil MS DANIEL A veil

25 MR NESMITH a veil that Iwhere that veils when Im not on medication that veils gone and I can see straight I can see clearly When Im on any antipsychotics its like theres a veil But to be honest Ive finished my work as in I finished the video component of my work and now its my website linking all those videos

30

MS DANIEL Yep

MR NESMITH So itit Idont need that creativity so much now anymore but

35

MS So whats your view about taking being discharged from here in a week or two and then going

MR NESMITH Please say yeah Please say yeah

40

MS DANIEL Well I we dont have much control over that but then they would the doctors recommend that you stay in contact with City Mental Health every two weeks to start off with to have an injection and the moving probably to every month

45

MR NESMITH Why injection I hate needles like needles I really really hate needles

MS Probably because they thought

5

MR DREW Youre not answering the question The question is

MS Well are you sayingtbat youd be happy to take oral medication

10

MR NESMITH Yes maam

MS DANIEL You need to reliably take it

15 MR NESMITH I would I promise

MS Yeah What went wrong or what happened with he three other hospitals you went to Do you know why they discharged you or was it on the basis that you have treatment indistinct

20

MR NESMITH They just yes it was only Olanzapine too but the only reason that I could not continue with Olanzapine because when I moved to the US they were really really expensive It was like 3000 per month that they wanted me to pay for the medication and I could not do that

25

MS No So youd be happy to have Olanzapine orally MR NESMITH That would be good Yes maam

30 MR DREW Whats your current thought about the Masonic Lodge

MR NESMITH Its in the past now because Ive already done that work You know I never even went there so

35 MR DREW Youre not worried about them anymore

MR NESMITH No sir

MR DREW Theyre not going to ruin the world

40

MR NESMITH Theyre not going to ruin tbe world I dont know they probably will but its not my fault

MR DREW Youre not worried about that anymore

45

MH10812 120718 P29

MR NESMITH Well I did what I did I did everything I could to try to save it and thats it

MR DREW So who

5

MS By making your documentaries

MR NESMITH Hmmm Thats how I did it And I can do lots of things Like I dont have to I never even been to their lodge But I made a

IO documentary where because what happened I split the Freemasons because does anybody know the story of Pigmania

MS Yeah

15 MR NESMITH Thats true Freemasonry which is to basically theyre building like that the perfect woman right theyre thinking of that perfect woman and trying to chisel away but really theyre chiselling at the own heart but then through that process they find the perfect soul mate right And thats what Freemasonry started out as but they lost their origins So now I am just

20 like I am the leader of the Illuminati I this indistinct I split the Illuminati and lots of the Illuminati followed me I did the same thing to the Freemasons now So Im the leader of the Freemasons or I split it so some are some arent

25 MS How did you split it

MR NESMITH Divide and conquer It really works It really works What youve got to do is you got to get the people thatyou got to encourage the people you got to show the light you got to show how what Im doing is

30 way better than what theyre doing

MS And do you think you can show that by having your material available on the web

35 MR NESMITH Yes maam Yes maam Most definitely

MS Okay All right so

MS Did doctor Les have any more questions

40

MS Doctor Les do you have any more questions MR DREW No I havent indistinct

45 MS All right Ms Banks did you want to is there anything else Mr

MHIOS12 120718 P30

Nesmith needs to tell us or you that you need to ask him to tell us Any questions that you have for him

MS BANKS No Not at this stage It think weve had a long chat yesterday

5 and a brief chat this morning so I think I do have some instructions here youve pretty much covered most of the things that we talked about but in terms of the legislative issues I think I can hone in a little bit more if thats possible

10 MR NESMITH Im not aggressive and Im not violent and I live a beautiful life I love the life that I live And I would not trade it any other life and I really pray that you dont try to make me live a life that isntthat isnt compatible with y psychology because thats when thats when I II be

youll be hurting me if you do that Im happy being eccentric I like who I

15 am and I like my role in this world which I crafted and I really hope that you

can dismiss this order and let me on my own free will take the treatment that you provide me In my own free will because I will I will

MS DANIEL Ms Halsey would you have any questions for Mr Nesmith

20

MS HASLEY No I spent a lot of time with Wendell yesterday afternoon didnt we We had a good chat He read me some of his material I had a look at some of his videos Hes got a couple of books published He spent ten years building up this body of knowledge that he has on the internet and on his

25 website that hes making available for other people I think you know he he consistently consistently professed his pacifist nature That hes you know not aggressive Hes not going to hurt anybody Theres no risks in that Im probably a little bit biased towards Mr Nesmiths way of life because I have arm of my own family thats very similar to this Somebody who is the same

30 age that also studied philosophy and also is a little bit left of centre and doesnt sort of fit within society norms Hes fabulous I could spend hours I could spend days with him I could spend weeks with him You know he doesnt live in the same world as I live in and obviously you know the intellect is sort of way above what I can comprehend And I think we do have an awesome

35 intellect here and something that you know I think would be doing a disservice if we dulled that and tried to control that too much And that is my concern I think you know hes living a good life I think hes a very good person His intentions are good Yes it may not be you know what we think is the norm And there may be some mental illness there but I think we have to so1t of

40 establish whether he is refusing any treatment for that and I dont think he is Whether he is a risk to himself and others and Im not sure that weve established that either I just have some concerns that you know we have a remarkable human being here whos done a lot of work A lot of University study and I just wouldnt like to dull that and control that Thats all I have to

45 say Thank you

MHl 0812 120718 P31

MS DANIEL All right Well we might go back and just ask Doctor ONeil or Mr Thomas if they wanted to summarise the situation from their point of view and then well ask Ms Banlcs to finish for us

5

MR DREW I want to go firstindistinct what means of order did you have in mind

MS ONEIL Thats a difficult question because we didnt submit the

10 application or the order I guess

MR DREW indistinct context Youve seen him for indistinct

MS Yeah about a week and a half

15

MR DREW A week and a half

MS ONEIL I mean in order to establish the injections over a period of a few months I mean I guess a few months would be a good starting point That

20 way he could have his next injection in a fortnight another one a month after that and hopefully he would be doing well at that stage

MR DREW So three months

25 MS ONEIL I thinlc three months would be a good a good idea To just really have a good period of stable indistinct

MR DREW Observation

30 MS DANIEL Mr Thomas did you have any further comments of what we should think about when we get to go and have a talk about what to decide

MR THOMAS I guess just from a community perspective my concern is at the moment acknowledging the huge change in Mr Nesmiths changed metal

35 state on treatment I agree with the doctors that theres been a substantial change from my engagements with him I guess my concern from this point of view is acknowledging that Mr Nesmiths not saying hes violent at this current point in time but just bring to light the fact that he was irate in the Centrelink and that required the APP to be called and to be handcuffed due to his

40 delusional beliefs wanting to access forms allowing him to defy God when the forms when advised they didnt exist demanding

MS Last time I went to Medicare Id like to stop you there

45 MR THOMAS No thats okay

MH10812 120718 P32

MS I asked cause I was very cross with them I asked who I could complain to and they said I could only complain online And I said I want a form to complain on

5

MR THOMAS Yep

MS and Im not leaving her until you give me a form

10 MR THOMAS So the form

MS So I sat down and I waited and eventually somebody came and they wont give you a form to complain on in writing to a real person

15 MS Yep

MS Youre obliged to go and do something online Its infuriating IfId been a man I have no doubt someone would have gone we dont have time for this woman man lets just call the police and they can put the

20 handcuffs on

MR THOMAS Yep so the form

MS So I dont

25

MR THOMAS No thats okay

MS I you may think this guy was brought in in handcuffs but it doesnt necessarily mean he was indistinct

30

MR THOMAS No I have I spoke with the police that was there back when the time the form that Mr Nesmith wanted was the form that was advising him to defy God and theres no form that exists for that

35 MS That might have been his summaiy of the form

MR THOMAS That was his words and they explained that to him

MS Why would he have to be handcuffed

40

MR THOMAS Because he pushed through the police after he was advised that they were going to wait for the mental health to come and speak with him and when he

45 MS Hepushed through the police to leave

MR THOMAS He pushed no to get back into Centrelink to get this form So he actually pushed through them to get through the doors to get into Centrelink and he wasnt handcuffed until that point When hes actually and

5 physically came into contact the police and they believe he was also speaking about he if doesnt get the form I spoke with an officer by the name of Katie who advised that he would blow up bridges and referred to it as a metaphor to get this form So thats my concern

IO MS Thats if and he said he would blow bridges but that that was a metaphor

MR THOMAS Ina metaphor term but hes also spoken about engaging iu hand to hand combat with people part of the Freemasons so

15

MS Do you think the police know what a metaphor is

MR THOMAS I think they do but they had enough concern to bring him in with that

20

MS Iknow it sounds indistinct it doesnt

MR THOMAS But the form but I guess my principle that Im trying to emphasise is the form that he needed didnt exist advised that it didnt exist

25 wanting to videotape people

MR DREW It couldnt possibly be in existence

MR THOMAS Yeah So I think his rational for becoming upset

30

MS Well he might have been speaking about a indistinct

MR THOMAS So Ive been upset with Centrelink myself and I guess being upset over something that doesnt exist and trying to explain is different to

35 being upset about processes and principles to being upset about something thats based on delusional and doesnt exist Thats my concern

MS Mr Nesmith what was the form

40 MR NESMITH It was not a form thats why I dont understand it Theres so many lies in this and you just assume the lies are truth Okay what happened was I went into Centrelink to tell them to ask about artificial intelligence that needs to be where my job is right because God has commanded me to invest everything into artificial intelligence because if we

45 release artificial intelligence with out a moral framework then its going to start

MH10812 120718 P34

destroying us Its going to start killing us because were not logical creatures because we do stuff like this and it makes no sense because all Im trying to do is save the world and Im getting into trouble for trying to save the world So I need to be I need a job thats in artificial intelligence So I went to

5 Centrelink and told them that that because Salvation Army indistinct said that Id just take any job

MS Have you done nay work in computer science Have you got any sort of experience in coding

MR NESMITH Yeah yeah I code Im a programmer

MS Do you know how to code So youve got a degree in coding

or

15

MR NESMITH No but I have two I have a certificate two in information technology and I have a diploma in PC repair and I have a diploma in Java programming

20 MS Okay

MS BANKS He has a fairly fairly extensive website

MR NESMITH And so

25

MS Cause this is the future artificial intelligence MR NESMITH It is

30 MS DANIEL We will be replaced very soon MR NESMITH Yes

MS DANIEL with artificial decision making technology

35

MR NESMITH And do you want it to have more framework MS DANIEL Thats athis is the big issue

40 MR NESMITH See thats my big issue Thats why God is telling me because I know how to do it right Thats why God is telling me I have to do this in artificial intelligence They just want me to get any job Like a McDonaldsjob or something like that but I cant do that Gods saying because Im best Im the best person to be able to implement this because I

45 spent my whole life doing it I cant go and get a McDonalds job So they

MHI0S12 120718 P35

told me to go to Centrelink So I went to Centrelink I talked to the guy about it and he said that under your situation he gave me a few papers and stuff he said under your situation you will have to defy God in order to continue to receive our payments

5

MS DANIEL Well that sounds sensible Im sure God will be in with that because if you have to get income in order to progress to get the job in artificial intelligence then youre going to have to work at Maccas or somewhere for the short term

10

MR NESMITH But its not logical because what happens when what happens if it happens in six months and Im not I need to be working in artificial intelligence

15 MS DANIEL But youve got to do it step by step

MR NESMITH But step by step is spending the last ten years working on the software This is an operating system that Ive created for artificial intelligence

20

MS Have you worked in IT before Mr Nesmith MRNESMITH Yesmaam

25 MS Have you been in paid employment in IT

MR NESMITH Yes ma am

MS Where

30

MS Who for

MR NESMITH Royal Flying Doctors Service Beckers Amtec Netway Internet Netway Computers many more A lot more

35

MS So that was in America was it

MR NESMITH No those are all in Australia but there is Computer Plus thats in America and then there is theres another computer place that was in

40 America too But what happened is I because they told me straight out that their systems are under my conditions their system is making me defy God So I said Can I please have that in writing And they said they said No no were not going to write that And I said Then can I please film you saying that And then they said No no no And then I said Well then

45 we have a problem I never got irate I never got upset I never raised my

MH10812 120718 P36

voice right I said Okay then Im not look you said it to me Im not going to leave until I get some type of confirmation for this right So eventually they turned on the alarms called the police and told me to go sit over there quietly which I did And then when the police came they took me outside and

5 and then the police were trying to stay leave They want you to leave so leave And I said I cant leave until I get that bit of information that because they told me that their systems are causing me to defy God and I need to get that information so I can then publicly release it

IO MS DANIEL So do you understand that to that what that explanation that youve just given sounds completely completely strange and unreal and delusional to your ordinary police officer on the street Do you are you able to understand from the AFP Police officers point of view that explanation is really out there

15

MR NESMITH Okay

MS DANIEL Do you see that

20 MR NESMITH Well I

MS DANIEL Can you see his perspective

MR NESMITH Well my perspective is that

25

MS DANIEL No Can you see his MR NESMITH Okay

30 MS DANIEL Can you see

MR NESMITH Yeah I think thats

MS DANIEL from the police officer

35

MR NESMITH Everybody but theres so many systems in this world that cause you to defy God and and if and if I could get the evidence and publicly release that then that shows how terrible the system is because its directly causing you to defy God

40

MS DANIEL Yeah And that makes sense to you but that doesnt make sense to the police officer whos just been called out on a job because some blokes causing havoc at Centrelink and we dont understand it

45 MR NESMITH And see what happened was because I wanted it in writing

and they said I didnt push through police I just but they what happened was they said they said Well arrest you if you go back in

MS DANIEL Yeah

5

MR NESMITH And MS DANIEL And

10 MR NESMITH But they were trying to get me to go away They were like Just leave just leave And and I said But I need that documentation And they they said The only way youre getting that documentation is if you back in because then well have to write a police report So I started to walk back in and then they they both attacked me and and then handcuffed

15 me right And then theres where the story is I didnt push through police officers I just started to walk back in and the thing is I didnt even get in before I was tackled to the ground and my face smashed against the wall

MS DANIEL Righto I can understand so clearly how that all unravelled So

20 thank you for that Mr Nesmith Ms Banks do you want to finish our hearing today by summing up the position from Mr Nesmiths point of view on what he submits we should do

MS BANKS Yes So as indicated at the beginning the making of a

25 psychiatric treatment order is opposed Obviously Mr Nesmith does not want one He has made that very clear but from a legal point of view in my submission the questions of refusal and the questions of risk of harm to self or others theres not enough evidence to make those out Mr Nesmith is clearly quite passionate and hes made it very clear that he loves life and he enjoys the

30 way that he lives Obviously he lives in a world that doesnt quite understand the way that he lives and this has somewhat of a disabling effect on him in some ways and I think hes just given a perfect example of that with his experience at Centrelink and president as you noted its very unlikely that the police would have understood the situation Miscommunication and I imagine

35 that this is something that Mr Nesmith potentially comes across in his daily life having to deal with agencies and bodies that dont think the same way that he does

When it comes to the question of refusal Mr Nesmith has already indicated

40 that hes happy to continue taking medication and indeed that was his instructions to me He will continue to take the medication regardless of whether an order is in place In particular he really likes to have contact with City Mental Health and he says that he had a worker there called Karina for quite a while He used to visit her once or twice a week and he said she their

45 relationship was very therapeutic He would like to continue in a relationship

like that and reengage with City Mental Health if possible These two things can be done without an order in place based on the instructions that

Mr Nesmith has given In regards to risk of harm to self or others or deterioration in my view and I concur with Chris on this this criteria hasnt

5 been made out Based on the evidence in the application and on the evidence that has been given theres theres postulation of potential risks but theres no evidence or history to suggest that risk of harm to others or any kind of violence is is a real problem

10 Even in this incident that happened at Centrelink it doesnt appear as though there was any violence or aggression Theres probably misunderstanding and probably some kind of I imagine that you were quite distressed at the time but that doesnt mean that its a risk to other people and arguably given the the length of history here given that Mr Nesmith had contact back in 2012 and

15 2013 for that period of time for there to be no evidence of violence or aggression or confronting people about these his system of beliefs I would argue that theres theres ce1tainly not enough there to reach that threshold for you to be satisfied that he is going to cause a risk to others In terms of risk to self hes already explained that he feels quite fit and healthy He gets food

20 He lives quite a good lifestyle He stays clean He enjoys nature obviously and enjoys bushwalking and looking after himself and it at this stage I would argue theres not enough evidence to suggest that theres a risk of harm to himself

25 In regards to the deterioration again theres no evidence to suggest that theres been a deterioration and we dont know if this has been his mental state the entire time and

MS DANIEL That is not the question The question is whether because of

30 his illness hes likely to suffer serious deterioration in his mental state and functioning

MS BANKS Yes Theres no history to suggest that there is a risk of deterioration

35

MS DANIEL Theres evidence from Dr ONeil of what the prognosis is if untreated

MS BANKS Yes

40

DR DREW Theres four admissions to the hospital to other hospitals

MS BANKS But we dont know if that was voluntary we dont know what the the nature of the admissions were interstate We do know that the

45 previous admission to Canberra Hospital was what I would argue is

misadventure and he was not kept for long at that stage The previous one there was concern from the GP but he hasnt been kept for

MS DANIEL There was

5

MS BANKS a long period of time

MS DANIEL

10 MS BANKS Yes

indistinct for a psychiatric treatment order

MS DANIEL And it was not made

MS BANKS Yes Yeah we dont mow the reason it wasnt well I dont

15 know the reason it wasnt made on the previous occasion but obviously there there was some the criteria were not met for making the order Hes hes obviously held this system of beliefs for a long time and the work that hes been doing has been over the past 10 years Hes been doing his philosophy degree for the last 10 years Hes obviously a thinker

20

MS DANIEL If hed been well he mightve got it done in three

MS BANKS I know people who are well who get it done in 10 years so I mean its just

25

MS DANIEL If hed been well though indistinct wouldnt have been homeless

MS BANKS He may have yes

30

MS DANIEL If hed been well his mental state and functioning wouldve been if hed been treated his mental state and functioning mightve been more optimal and he wouldve still had all of his passion for nature and for intellectual engagement in these new technologies and all of that He wouldnt

35 have been distracted by delusional thought content

MS BANKS Thats thats assuming that it is delusional thought content and that there is an illness

40 MS DANIEL So you think that this stuff about the Masons and the child sacrifice is not delusional

MS BANKS Im not a doctor Im a lawyer

45 MS DANIEL Okay

MS BANKS And Im acting on

DR DREW No no no

5

MS BANKS Im acting on instructions

DR DREW No you cant get away with it like that Do you think it sounds realistic You dont have to be a doctor

MS DANIEL Does Mr Nesmith on instructions tell us that thats the situation

MS BANKS Yes Thats his views Yes

15

MS DANIEL Thats his view

MS BANlS Absolutely Hes made that very clear to the tribunal this morning

20

DR DREW Its not a view its a belief MS DANIEL Its a belief yes

25 MS BANKS Well yes belief I have already said system of beliefs Im not

Im not trying

DR DREW But do you think its a realistic

30 MS BANKS to step away from that

MS DANIEL Her view is not important

MS BANKS Yeah Its really

35

MS DANIEL indistinct Mr Nesmith

MS BANKS Thats not appropriate for me to put my view forward

40 MS DANIEL Yes

MS BANKS In

MS DANIEL So obviously my concern is that Mr Nesmiths life has been

45 lost to him

MS BANKS He hes happy

MS DANIEL Hes perfectly happy

5

MS BANKS Hes happy Hes MS DANIEL Hes perfectly happy

10 MS BANKS He enjoys his lifestyle and MS DANIEL He couldve been professor

MS BANKS there are I mean thats us thats us

15

MS DANIEL In a tent He could still be in a tent but be a professor

MS BANKS Thats us thinking that being a professor is a good thing I mean thats thats something that you work towards and again this is corning

20 in to the social construct of our idea of what is normal and what people strive towards and what they should be doing if they have this intelligence

MS DANIEL Thats true On his own submission to us he wants to save the world and hes going to do probably a better job of that if hes able to

25 promulgate his beliefs and lecture and all of that than creating a website which I rn not even sure is functional

MS BANKS It is

30 MS DANIEL It is

MR NESMITH It is

MS BANKS Yes absolutely

35

MR NESMITH But I dont I am a professor because every single second of every single day theres about between four and 600 people that are watching my videos

40 MS DANIEL Mrnhrn

MR NESMITH So right now maybe theres 400 people watching my videos In an hour maybe therell be 525 people watching my videos I am a professor Im just an online professor and and I dont see any need for me to

45 go and be a professor in a real in a real school a real university because Im

MH10812 120718 P42

doing it all online and Im Im giving it away for free too because thats what I think a real education is I love I love my fans so much that I want to give them away all that thats in my heart in my head to them for free and Im trying to work a way to make it donations based But the platform had to be

5 completely created before before it was before I was able to do that So soon there will be donations and hopefully I can get these donations to then support me so I II no longer require Centrelink assistance

MS DANIEL Can I ask you a question about your willingness to take tablets MR NESMITH Yes maam

MS DANIEL If youre willing to take tablets why havent you been doing

that in all your interactions with City Mental Health over the last couple of I5 years I presume theyve been suggesting to you that you take tablets

MR NESMITH I was in Mexico

MS DANIEL Okay

20

MS BANKS He only returned

MR NESMITH I just got back I just got back from Mexico

25 MS DANIEL But what about when you were in Lismore and Ballarat and Cairns because you have indicated that youve taken a range of

antipsychotics

MR NESMITH Yes

30

MS DANIEL I think youve given us some views MR NESMITH Olanzapines been the best

35 MS DANIEL Yes So after each admission when youve gone away from the hospital have they given you medication

MR NESMITH I continue

40 MS DANIEL to take

MR NESMITH I always continued yes Thats the only reason MS DANIEL But how did you reappear to the I mean youve clearly

45 brought yourself to the attention of other people in order to be admitted to

MHI0S12 120718 P43

hospitals So how did you get in to Lismore Hospital What happened there Briefly

MR NESMITH Lismore Hospital

5

MS DANIEL Or Cairns or Ballarat One of them What happened to get you back into the hospital

MR NESMITH Making films that are controversial My films are

10 controversial

MS DANIEL All right I think we might just adjourn and have a conversation Now youre free to stay here of course and chat amongst yourselves but remember the microphones still recording us So dont say

15 anything you dont want someone to hear

MR NESMITH Thank you very much And please Ill be Ill be really good If you dont put an order on me Ill be really good and Ill take my meds and Ill have contact

20

ADJOURNED RESUMED

1102AM

1104AM

25 MS DANIEL All right Well were resuming matter MH108 of 2012 The tribunal is not going to decide this application today Were going to adjourn the application and we would like more evidence from the applicant It might be from Dr ONeil but I think that what might happen is if we adjourn this matter for three weeks that would give Mr Thomas City Mental Health an

30 oppmtunity to make contact with Ballarat MR THOMAS Yeah

MS DANIEL Cairns and Lismore Hospitals and obtain for us a full

35 medical history for Mr Nesmith IfI could give everyone for your assistance a summary of where were at we do believe that Mr Nesmith has a mental illness and that there is treatment that is recommended for that We are concerned about this question of risk of harm to self or others and the question of mental deterioration and we think that the longer term medical history will

40 give us some idea of what side of the line Mr Nesmiths case falls on So I cant tell you the exact date that were adjourning the matter to until I go back to the tribunal and get the date that this tribunal is sitting again Does that make sense Because weve heard so much and we need to go parthard on this hearing and finish on probably a Thursday afternoon hopefully in about

45 three weeks Does that make sense everyone

MH10812 120718 P44

MR NESMITH Yeah

MS DANIEL All right So what will happen for you Mr Nesmith is youre

5 currently in hospital under a detention order and that order I think requires you to stay in hospital for potentially up to 18 July So you will continue that doesnt mean that you will stay here until 18 July you will be talking with the treating team about when they think youre ready for discharge

10 MR NESMITH I have a lot of work to do and I would really appreciate it

MS DANIEL Yeah So this is not a decision that this tribunal makes This is a decision that the treating team make

15 MR NESMITH Okay

MS DANIEL when to discharge you At the moment they have authority to hold you here even if you wanted to discharge yourself until 18 July But they might decide that youre right to go home earlier Okay

20

MR NESMITH Okay Thank you very much

MS DANIEL Can I ask whats being done about Mr Nesmiths possessions Because theyre on the side of a hill at the moment arent they Your tent and

25 your swag

MR NESMITH Mmhm

MS DANIEL So is anyone doing anything to make sure noone goes and

30 scavenges them

MR THOMAS Mr Nesmith hasnt actually indistinct to us where he stays so were unable to

35 MR NESMITH But you wouldnt

MS DANIEL Are they safe where they are

MR NESMITH Noone would be able to find it

40

MS DANIEL Okay

MR NESMITH No because its possums would be going through everything

45

MS DANIEL Possums

MS BANKS You said that you keep your important papers and whatnot in a locker

5

MS DANIEL Yeah

MS BANKS At the indistinct centre

10 MS DANIEL You dont want thats an expensive swag You dont want to lose that swag

MS DAVIES And your heater

15 MS DANIEL If some human being found it thats all All right So when you get the order which we will type up and get sent to you this afternoon It will say these proceedings are adjourned to and then theres a date and a time It will be an afternoon It will be potentially not here but in the

City Mental Health building but on level 4 All right

20

MS STEELE So I think if I may interrupt Mr Nesmith from my perspective this also gives you the opportunity to take treatment that the doctors are prescribing involuntarily

25 MR NESMITH Yeah I will

MS STEELE And keep in touch with City Mental Health and reach out to your case worker

30 MR NESMITH Yes I will

MS STEELE And ask them what theyre going to do so that we have some established history that you are going to take your treatment Because youre clearly much better now Youre presenting quite well today than what you

35 were on admission So thats a really important responsibility that you have and I think the other issue is we dont have an address

MR NESMITH Well

40 MS BANKS If you could do the hearing notice and send it to me I II MS DANIEL Will you give it

MS STEELE Okay Thats great

45

MR NESMITH Do you need an address to send mail Is that what you need

MS DANIEL Longer term we will but at the moment well just send this

5 copy of this order today to Ms Steele and shell give it to you

MR NESMITH Okay

MS DANIEL Print it out and give it to him so youve got that

10

MR NESMITH Okay thank you

15

MS STEELE So you need to go find when youre released indistinct and keep indistinct

MR Yeah so shes only personally I think the next three weeks after this one so Im s01t of helping with Mr Nesmiths case because I was with the review But as a duty officer Im predominantly at the office So if you present to the reception youll be able to ask for me Iflm not there

20 somebody else will be able to grab these details from you

MR NESMITH Okay Would I be able to get Karina back

MR So Karina actually works for a different team So Karina works for

25 the access team which kind of triages MR NESMITH Did she change

MR No see Karina was always indistinct that was the access team

30 So somebody who isnt known to us because you came back from Mexico you werent open to a community team so that team assesses somebody if they need assistance from mental health and it was deemed that you did So she referred us you to us as the community team for longer term care So Karina just does short term assessments for people to sort of refer them on to longer

35 term care

MR NESMITH Okay

MR So she only does brief interactions with people

40

MR NESMITH Okay

MS DANIEL Okay Well thank you everyone for coming Its been a lengthy hearing and weve covered a lot of information I will see you in

45 approximately three weeks time

MR NESMITH Thank you very much Appreciated

CANBERRA

336 PM THURSDAY 2 AUGUST 2018

MS HALSEY Yes staying for that Hes out there

5

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Hes outside MS HALSEY Yes

10 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL We might ask him if he wants to come in Anywhere is fine so long as youve got a microphone The ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal is sitting today to consider an application for a psychiatric treatment order for Wendell Charles Nesmith This is matter 108 of 2012 Well just start by all introducing ourselves Im presidential member

15 Daniel Im the presiding member on the tribunal this afternoon

MEMBER DAVIES Im Robyn Davies community member hello

SENIOR MEMBER DREW Im Les Drew psychiatrist

20

MS HANSON Im Julie Hanson from the city mental health team MS MABEY Im Kate Mabey from the city mental health team

25 MR NESMITH Im Wendell Charles Nesmith and Im a philosopher

MS BATES Adele Bates legal aid ACT representing for Mr Nesmith today

MS TRACEY Penny Tracey from the public advocate

30

MS HALSEY Chris Halsey from the public advocate

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay good Ms Hanson I got indistinct your last name

35

MS MABEY Mabey MABEY

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Youre both from City Mental Health

40 MS MABEY Yes

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I think the last time we were all together a couple of weeks ago we were at the adult mental health unit Mr Nesmith was there for a short while and on that occasion I think Mr Ke Thomas

45

MS MABEY Yes

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Hes from your team Hes on leave

5 MS HANSON Hes on leave yes

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So he came and Mr Nesmith was there and Ms Bates you were there too werent you

10 MS BATES Iwasyes

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Ms Halsey was there

MS HALSEY Yes

15

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So for the record I II just summarise where we got to on that occasion The tribunal had heard a lot of evidence but we had a couple of questions in our mind The first was was Mr Nesmith going to refuse treatment upon discharge from hospital He said he wasnt

20 going to and we didnt know when he was going to be discharged even at that stage The second issue was that the treating team said to us look what is the risk for Mr Nesmith if he doesnt have appropriate treatment and when we asked that question they said hes had actually multiple admissions and so hes obviously coming into contact with the public or the authorities or something

25

Hes been admitted several times in other places so we dont know anything about that but we say that it means that he is at risk Hes vulnerable or something and so we said in the adjournment period the treating team could perhaps chase up for us information about these other admissions as well as

30 giving Mr Nesmith in the adjournment period he will have been discharged he can get back to his life and he can then come back and talk to us about what treatment has been recommended for him after discharge and whats his view about that

35 Those I think were the two factors that we wanted to hear about today I wonder I might ask maybe Ms Hanson or Ms Mabey one of you perhaps as the treating team to start by updating us on Mr Nesmiths discharge from hospital and what the plan for his treatment is going forward Is there a need for treatment going forward

40

MS HALSEY Mr Nesmith was reviewed by Dr Flynn who did the original report prior to his admission He was reviewed on

MR NESMITH The 31st

45

MH10812 020818 P3

MS HANSON The 31st

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Thats only this week

5 MR NESMITH Yes two days ago

MS HANSON Yes Her impression is that he is agreeable to treatment however its been explained that its more its sort of the lesser of two evils Its really to avoid having to go back to hospital

10

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL What is the recommended treatment I mean three weeks ago it was we think you should stay in hospital for a couple more days So thats not the situation anymore

15 MS HANSON No I believe its to continue with the medication

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Whats that medication

MS HANSON At the moment hes on Olanzapine

20

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Is that a tablet MS HANSON No hes on a depo injection

25 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL How often is that

MS HANSON Fortnightly

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL What else is part of the treatment plan

30

MS HANSON It says here that hes actually also on some oral medication as well Thats now changed So to continue engagement with Dr Flynn I think the plan was also that we were going to help him with some housing

35 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I II stop you there When people say continue engagement with Dr Flynn or mental health thats just to me thats just waffle No person indistinct but its like a summary What I really want to know is who has he got to see and when How often

40 MS HANSON Hes got to see PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Dr Flynn

MS HANSON Yes Dr Flynn

45

MHl 0812 020818 P4

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL How often

MS HANSON Im just having a look at her last report when she says her when she next wants to see him Can I ask Mr Nesmith did she make another

5 appointment

MR NESMITH No we havent but Dr Flynn says she wants to see me probably about monthly but Kels probably weekly but weII probably change to go it fortnightly Thats what they were saying which is good for me

10

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Ke weekly for the moment and then move to fortnightly

MS HANSON Mr Thomas is currently our duty officer and Mr Nesmith has

15 been assigned a clinical manager and shes currently on leave

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay so Ke will keep in touch with

Mr Nesmith until she gets back

20 MS HANSON Yes

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL And then there will be a handover

MS HANSON Yes

25

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So Ke weekly at the moment MS HANSON Yes

30 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay and then moving to fortnightly and the new case manager will come in

MS HANSON Yes

35 MEMBER DAVIES Can I take you back to the meds Olanzapine depo fmtnightly

MS HANSON Fortnightly yes

40 MEMBER DAVIES Then are you reading the report of the 31st that talks about oral meds

MS HANSON It did say oral medication but my understanding is that that has now been ceased He was given seven days supply on discharge and then

45 commenced the fortnightly injection

MH10812 020818 P5

MEMBER DAVIES So thats the transitional oral meds until the depo kicks m

5 MS HANSON Thats right

MEMBER DAVIES All right thank you

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So we got an email so what we have IO before us is this We had the original report application that we had at the hospital three weeks ago and then today we got an email from the tribunal

liaison officer saying that they had received hospital notes from Ballarat and Cairns hospitals Please advise if you want these emailed to you and I said yes and weve got those but we can barely read them but theyre better than

15 nothing and then theres a summary here from the tribunal liaison officer Ill read this to you because I dont think its been copied to you at legal aid

Ms Bates Its all positive

Wendell has been engaging with city mental health accepting

20 treatment and psychiatric review to avoid ji1rther torture ie going back to hospital Im sure the case manager will attend to the hearing and provide the tribunal with fi1rther information as requested After psychiatric review on 31 July 2018 remains very fixed around his beliefs but seems less driven than prior to

25 hospitalisation Very grandiose no insight that he has a psychotic illness is agreeing have farther treatment because of fears of further torture eg going back to hospital Engagement will continue to be fraught with this tension but currently was able to establish good rapport today The ongoing plan continue

30 Olanzapine depo consider dose increase indistinct arrange new GP at the interchange

So you need a new GP

35 MR NESMITH Yes but they wont take new patients right now

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL The interchange practice

MR SHORT Yes

40

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Needs to start process ofDSP I think thats disability support pension

Housing support need to explore all emergency temporary housing

45 options Centreink certificate dated until midOctober

MHIOS12 020818 P6

Diagnosis schizophrenia See scanned copy Case manager to look into psychological and other support

I suppose Centrelink likes there to be a diagnosis on their certificates

5

MS HANSON There has to be a diagnosis

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Hence that because I understand

Mr Nesmith you might disagree with that word of schizophrenia but it may be

10 what Centrelink needs to receive on the certificate to start paying you DSP

C 15

MR SHORT Its okay its a type of personality disorder its pretty close to schizophrenia anyway I just dont hear voices or dont see things that arent there

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay so its not too far from MR NESMITH Theyre both schiz

20 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL what youd accept Yes theyre both schiz

MR NESMITH Im still schizo no matter how you look at it

25 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL If you want to have a label you can have that label yes All right so thats a document we have Im going to ask a copy of that to get made for Ms Bates and Mr Nesmith just so your file is complete

30 MSBATES Thankyou

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL But theres no information in there that wasnt Ive written on that so youll have to get a copy off

35 MS HALSEY Can we have a copy of that please president

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL You havent got a copy either Ms Halsey

MS HALSEY No no

40

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Can you just get another copy printed out Make two copies one for Ms Halsey and one for Ms Bates Thank you That then updates us on the heatment plan thank you Ms Hanson Thats I think complete Is there anything else on the treatment plan Dr Drew

45

MH10812 020818 P7

SENIOR MEMBER DREW Not about the treatment plan but about the attitude towards the plan Sorry who was the psychiatrist

MS HANSON Dr Flynn

5

MS MABEY Dr Carolyn Flynn

SENIOR MEMBER DREW Right okay Is she a psychiatrist

10 MS MABEY Shes a registrar

MS HANSON Shes a registrar

SENIOR MEMBER DREW What I would have liked to know is her attitude

15 towards whether or not a PTO was needed

MS HANSON What she explained to us just before corning up to hear this is that she felt that it was needed because Mr Nesmith has a history of being itinerant and moving from state to state and has never really engaged with

20 services for a long time to try and improve or I guess make a difference with treatment

SENIOR MEMBER DREW Yes I would have thought that having a PTO would be encouraging to

25

MS HANSON Yes yes

SENIOR MEMBER DREW rather than the same I would have thought ifwe could involve him in treatment on a quasivoluntary basis so he can still

30 live where he wants to and do what he likes as long as he involves the treatment

MS HANSON I think her concern was that sorry

35 MS MABEY Hes vulnerable

MS HANSON Yes and also the fact that he was only accepting of treatment because it was the lesser of two you know the sort of two evils to avoid having to go back to hospital and so there was that period he wouldnt engage with

40 treatment

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I will ask you about that

MR NESMITH Thats not true I actually went there from the beginning on

45 my own free will

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes we pointed that out last time didnt we

5 MR NESMITH From the beginning right when I got to Canberra I made the appointments Within the first week that I was in Canberra I was in mental health

SENIOR MEMBER DREW So your position is that youll continue on this

10 treatment

MR NESMITH Of course I think its beneficial

SENIOR MEMBER DREW whether or not youre a PTO

15

MR NESMITH Yes sir I think its beneficial for me

MEMBER DAVIES That contrasts Mr Nesmith with the notes we have from Queensland in particular where you are taking yourself off oral meds and

20 theres a consistency

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I might get a copy I might give my copy of these notes to Ms Bates Its very hard to read but it does indicate that at points you were like discharged with some oral medication What happened

25 Mr Nesmith

MR NESMITH The only reason that I stopped taking my medication is because I went to the US and the medication was 600 per month there and I could not afford 600 per month for the medication I would have stayed on it

30 if it was not for that

MEMBER DAVIES So these notes do say that in 2016 that you went to the US but in front of me here Ive got a psych history that says you were treated with Risperidone in Ballarat in

35

MR NESMITH Risperidone is bad No

MEMBER DAVIES Canberra in 2013 Lismore 2014 with Olanzapine and that you didnt like those medications

40

MR NESMITH I dont like Risperidone at all

MEMBER DAVIES In fact you have there is at page 47 Im just pointing out that there is precedents here where you have stopped taking medications in

45 the past

MR NESMITH I went from Risperidone to Olanzapine

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay Where did you go to be prescribed

5 the Olanzapine Was that still in Queensland

MEMBER DAVIES It was Lismore according to

MR NESMITH It was Lismore but I also had it in Queensland too

10

MEMBER DAVIES He reports that he doesnt like our medications and they make him feel terrible

MR NESMITH Mostly in reference to the Risperidone

15

MEMBER DAVIES Doesnt believe he needs medication

MS HALSEY IfI can just jump in there please president Wendell has said to me that he would much prefer having a depo injection than having medication

20 because you know you dont have the risk of forgetting your medication and he said himself that you know on pills he was forgetting it and he would actually prefer to have depo

MS TRACEY Can I just say what he has said at the review was that he was

25 resigned to taking medication to please us and to avoid being tortured anymore

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL You dont want to be taken into hospital SENIOR MEMBER DREW My position would be Wendell that Im quite

30 convinced by reading all of this material that you do suffer from schizophrenia and that you need treatment and that you ought to be taking this treatment with a treatment order or not

MR NESMITH I agree I think I should be taking this treatment

35

SENIOR MEMBER DREW I think you should It will make your life so much better

MRNESMITH Yes

40

SENIOR MEMBER DREW It really will because otherwise you will be tortured all the time because people will just continue taking you back to hospital

45 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL You dont want that

MR NESMITH When I refer to torture Im talking Im referring to the hospital specifically Im not talking about anything outside of the hospital sir

5 SENIOR MEMBER DREW No no Its also if you dont take if you do have treatment continuing you will be much more productive than you are Really productive

MR NESMITH I agree I agree

10

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So I guess we now understand that the proposed treatment plan is going forward and we understand the concerns that Dr Flynn has that and weve got read through the notes that we can read

We understand that theres a history of falling out of treatment and some of

15 that is because of the medication being too expensive while he was overseas some of it is around it was actually there was times where the medication prescribed to you did not work for you as well

So for whatever reason theres been a failure to get adequate treatment or

20 engage with adequate treatment in the past I might just ask Ms BATES first Ms BATES do you have any questions for Ms Hanson about the proposed treatment engagement with treatment acceptance of treatment anything on this topic

25 MS BATES Thank you Despite the reasoning for engagement in treatment has Wendell been engaging since he was released indistinct

MS HANSON So he did come to the review yes

30 MS BATES He has presented indistinct MS HANSON Yes he did

MS BATES Just to clarify

35

MS HANSON I think that did take quite a number of like we did actually have to spend some time locating him His phone was not working was not accepting incoming calls

40 MR NESMITH You had the wrong number

MS HANSON Okay

MR NESMITH I came in

45

MH10812 020818 P11

MS HANSON Yes when we contacted

MR NESMITH It was apparently like an hour after you called

5 MS BATES Is the plan to move to indistinct

MS HANSON Well that will be dependent on whether this you know medication does work for him This is a fortnightly medication However on a higher dose it can be changed to a monthly injection yes

10

MS BATES This is a better print

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I dont need a copy

15 DR DREW You dont need a copy

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL No

MS BATES This is indistinct

20

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes This is a better printout Ms llATES than the one I gave you Its much more readable

MR NESMITH It couldnt be worse

25

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL It couldnt Ms Halsey did you have any questions for Ms Hanson on the topic of treatment plans and treatment engagement

30 MS HALSEY As youre probably aware Ive been keeping in fairly close contact with Wendell and meeting up with him and involved in the housing applications and that sort of thing Now I understand that he was allocated a case manager Nakem But Nakem is on leave currently so Ke has taken over Ke is who Wendell thought was his case manager but I understand that Ke is

35 the duty manager thats just been MS HANSON Yes standing in Yeah

MS HALSEY But the last I know that the last few days Ke hasnt been at

40 work either

MS HANSON No Ke hasnt been there either

MS HALSEY So there hasnt actually been a case manager for Wendell to

45 connect with but he has tried I mean hes been taking paperwork in that sort

MFII0S12 020818 P12

ofthing

MS HANSON Yes We did receive his housing application yesterday It

was yesterday wasnt it that you dropped it in Weve got a support officer

5 that will be actually also working with Mr Nesmith to get that lodged

MS HALSEY And the DSP that sort of thing

MS HANSON Yes I think Dr Flynn is going to do a supporting letter in

10 relation to the housing

MS HALSEY Good Im happy to do a supporting letter for the housing as well But I thought that when I was talking to Kate when I was talking to you the other day Kate that the housing application had already been done and it

15 just needed

MS HANSON It had been given

MS HALSEY the bank statements and the 100 points

20

MS HANSON Yes we I think we were waiting from my instructors on the 100 points ID which now we have So its just a matter I think of

MS HALSEY Going into housing

25

MS HANSON Yes I think as indistinct

MR NESMITH That was all into social housing We still have the regular housing to do which shes

30

MS HALSEY For ACT Housing

MR NESMITH Chris can help me with that

35 MS HALSEY So you know he has been making hes been coming into City Mental Health hes been engaging hes done his psychiatric review hes coming for his depot Quite happy to have the depot and engage in care treatment and support and I think that he is really quite committed to staying in Canberra at this stage He wants ACT Housing

40

He wants secure housing so that he can come down and stop living in his tent So I think that shows a commitment that he is not going to abscond Hes not going to be itinerant any more He actually wants to stay here and he wants to actually do his work here So I dont think theres from my point of view I

45 dont think theres any indistinct at this stage I dont think theres a case to be

made for refusing it

DR DREW Can I just ask I dont want to be rude in saying this but is the city mental the best indistinct to be involving Wendell

5

MS HANSON Yes I think we are Yes I think weve got MR NESMITH Theyre really good

10 DR DREW I know theyre very good but theyre also very stretched

MS HANSON Yes I think were working very hard to try and support him You know we dont really have a choice at this particular point in time because he is living within our catchment area anyway You know that could change

15

DR DREW I was thinking about supported accommodation

MS HANSON Well the fact that Mr Nesmith is engaging in treatment so he wouldnt actually meet their criteria But if that changed well then there is

20 that possibility and thats irrespective of where he lives in Canberra

DR DREW indistinct is that going to make any difference

MS HANSON I think the concern my understanding from Dr Flynn is this

25 sort of history of nonengagement or being itinerant and not actually continuing with treatment on a sort of a long enough basis

DR DREW Sorry I was looking at it from the opposite end

30 MS HANSON Okay

DR DREW If you want a PTO you find a youre obliged to look after it If

hes not on a PTO well he might fall off

35 MS HANSON Well thats what my understanding is Thats whats happened in the past back in 2012 when he was sort of lost to indistinct the ACT

DR DREW Yes but that might have been his fault Im concerned it might

40 be your fault

MS HANSON Well

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Would you disengage ifhe wasnt on a

45 PTO

MHl 0812 020818 P14

MS HANSON Would we disengage No No we would not

DR DREW I mean Ive hes on a PTO youve got to actively go out and see

5 him every two weeks

MS HANSON Yes we do but I you know well I believe that we do actively also you know support a lot of people who arent on PTOs We are very stretched but

10

DR DREW Im not concerned

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Can you tell me Im going to ask a procedural this is an office question You have a number of open files Some

15 of them are on people who are voluntary patients A patient stops coming to see you When do you close the file

MS HANSON There are so many different circumstances or you know situations to take into account If a person is refusing to engage with us then

20 thats completely different I mean we will do everything we possibly can based on assessments We may even look at having to get an assessment order to actually get that person to reengage We dont just we try not to just stop Theres loads of people we dont do that

25 MS MABEY We try not to do that

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Im just wondering because

MS HANSON We have an MDT process

30

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Well I want to know what the process is

MS HANSON So if somebody was having difficulty engaging with a client or getting a client to engage with us we would ask we would

35

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL A voluntary client

MS HANSON A voluntary client yes We would first of all you might seek some peer support You might discuss it with the doctor that last

40 reviewed that person You would take it to an MDT process where

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Joe failed to turn up at his review this week and I rang and left a message and hes never called me back

45 MS HANSON Yes So we will start you know looking at do we go and

MHI0S12 020818 P15

knock on that persons door Do we start contacting family Next of kin As I said we will discuss it in a multidisciplinary team meeting as to how we can engage that person You know maybe theres somebody else on the team that has worked with that person in the past and they might you know have some

5 ideas You know just continually inviting them in We dont just we tend to not just let people just drop off the books

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Then what happens So youve tried for a month and the phone calls havent been replied to and youve been up to the

10 house and theyve

DR DREW Can I just say in this case In other cases you might just let it drop

15 MS HANSON You do also sometimes have to respect a persons right to if theyre voluntary to choose to engage with

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Thats what Im interested in

20 MS HANSON We do have to respect that and we do

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So you have a patient with mental health because you think theyve got a mental illness which is being treated by medication and monitoring They cease taking the medication they cease

25 engaging in monitoring and yet sometimes it seems to me files just get closed whereas I would have thought that all of that background information if you know someone has a mental illness which leave them at risk of misadventure or neglect or whatever and they cease engaging with their treatment and with their monitoring wouldnt that mean you should apply for an assessment

30 order

MS HANSON Every case is an individual and I cant answer that question based on everybody who ceases engagement with the city mental health team You know I think we also have to take into account that people can live in the

35 community with a mental illness and they can function very well We would look at you know has this person had contact with the AFP Has there been presentations to a hospital So we take a lot of things into account but people do have the right to live with a mental illness in the community and not necessarily be harassed by us But we also are looking at risks to themselves

40 and the risk to others So theres many ways that we can do that

DR DREW I would individualise the

MS HANSON Thats what I was saying We cant say theres a blanket

45

MHl0812 020818 P16

DR DREW From the tribunal I hope with support of the other members would say that in this case if Wendell says hes going to continue treatment and he doesnt then you ought to immediately apply for an assessment order

5 MS HANSON Apply for an assessment order

DR DREW So we can compulsorily get him back into treatment

MS HANSON Yes

10

DR DREW Because he does need to stay in treatment and hes telling us hes going to

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Would you need an assessment order or

15 would you just applywith all of this information wouldnt you just apply for a psychiatric treatment order

DRDREW YoucouldapplyforaPTO

20 MS HANSON Psychiatric treatment order yes I guess the risk the only the real risk that I see in this situation is if you become it remains itinerant and doesnt go through with housing is you know also locating somebody with the sort of a history of not engaging

25 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I think that is a serious issue

MS HANSON I see that as a big issue

MS HALSEY A psychiatric treatment order doesnt make someone

30 contactable because what I see on a regular basis is applications for revocation which say the person we believe has moved interstate and is no longer a person in relation to whom a psychiatric treatment order can be made

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL We do see that is what Dr Drews point

35 I think in saying having a psychiatric treatment order sometimes can provide people with an incentive to move interstate

MS HALSEY It is possible but then

40 MS HANSON We may also you know advise you know get in contact with mental health services in that state that we think they are and let them know that they have been on a treatment order in the ACT

DR DREW Look we dont want to push

45

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL No were not trying to put Mr Nesmith away Were trying to support him in the best way possible

DR DREW Ultimately I think the best option would be for him to not have a

5 treatment order but for you to be very aware that we expect youll apply for either an assessment order a treatment order ifh doesnt turn up for treatment

MS HANSON I think we have additional risks though The risks are you cant follow up Wendell in the same way that you can follow up other people

IO because you dont know where he lives and you cant MR NESMITH Ill show you

MS HANSON The staff cant

15

MS HALSEY indistinct

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL indistinct

20 MR NESMITH indistinct MS HANSON Its not realistic

DR DREW Wendell I think all of this was showing that the treatment is

25 having an effect Because you were no way inclined to tell us last time where you were You said it was so far away noone would find it You didnt want anybody to find it

MR NESMITH There is a difference between telling you where it is and

30 showing you where it is Because if Im showing you where it is youve made a commitment to see a little bit about my life that most people wouldnt even be interested in So to me that would be meaningful if you someone from the treating team could go with me and I could just show them one time where I live that would be really awesome I would I think that would be really kind

35 ofyou

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL You could meet them at a certain you know at a fence line

40 MR NESMITH I could

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL indistinct

MR NESMITH indistinct

45

MH10812 020818 P18

DR DREW indistinct activity indistinct

MR NESMITH Its never been Mount Ainslie Ive never said Mount Ainslie

5

MS BATES I thought it was Mount Ainslie

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes actually indistinct

10 MS BATES indistinct

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Its all through the reports

MR NESMITH indistinct

15

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I think this is the risk For me Im still concerned Im concerned because were relying entirely on Wendell to contact the service and we have a long history going back to 2010 2011 where he has dropped out of treatment You dont have the same tools in your toolkit that

20 you normally have You cant drop in on him you cant put a letter under his door or a card in his letterbox Youve had problems phoning Wendell today

MS HANSON No No problems phoning him We didnt have the right number

25

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL But the onus is entirely on Wendell and that worries me

DR DREW With the PTO the same things apply Youre not going to find

30 him just because hes on a PTO

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL But then theres that overarching MS HALSEY We have an avenue of being able to advise the police that we

35 need to locate this person

MS HANSON Wendell knows he has to come in

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL My concern is why wouldnt if you had

40 concerns for a voluntary patients health and wellbeing wouldnt you also call the police and say We have this patient Theyre a voluntary patient but we havent seen them for three weeks and now weve got concerns about their wellbeing

45 MS HALSEY We do do that

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So you dont need a PTO to call the police

5 MS HALSEY No you dont need a PTO to call the police but they are more inclined to assist us if somebody is

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL indistinct

10 MS HANSON indistinct MS HALSEY indistinct

MS HANSON I guess its because theyre resources Having a welfare check

15 done is

MS HALSEY indistinct

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Everyone has resource problems and

20 thats part of our concern here

MS HANSON Can I also just add that on the review that Mr Nesmith had with Dr Flynn the other day was where he did actually say and Im happy to provide you with a copy of this that you know Just let me be a free man

25 Why should you care what I believe in or what my inclinations are So to me that does that indicate you know that he wants to always engage with the team

MS MABEY Hes talking about his work

30

MR NESMITH Im talking about my work PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes Mr Nesmith

35 MR NESMITH The only time that Ive ever fallen out of treatment was when I moved interstate and then having to do all the reconnections because when you move interstate and youre homeless youre moving from one place youre homeless in one state and then you move to another state and youre homeless in that state you have to find all the resources The first thing you

40 need is food

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Now Mr Nesmith I have to tell you I think that you minimise the extent to which you werent proactive getting back into treatment because weve got the notes from 2011 and these are the notes

45 from I think Ballarat You reported having returned to Australia and

MH10812 020818 P20

accommodation had fallen through Youd become homeless in Melbourne where youd been homeless for two and a half week then walked to Melton obtaining a lift to Bathurst Marsh Police put you on the train to Ballarat

5 You had then you went and indistinct living in the bush and then the guesthouse So you lived in the bush on the outskirts of Ballarat for three to four weeks So that was June 2011

MS HANSON Our notes are in between 2012 and 2013 do indicate you

10 know there was a lot of difficulty getting Mr Nesmith to remain engaged with the team whilst he was here in the ACT There were a number ofreports

15

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So he was in the ACT what dates were that

MS HANSON That 2012 2013 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So he

20 MS HANSON There was a number of contacts with the AFP during that time as well

DR DREW On the other hand now hes got such a committed health team

25

MS HANSON Hell go hiking up Mount Ainslie

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Hike up there with your indistinct

30 DR DREW It is five years ago

MS HANSON It is yes

DR DREW This time Wendell has been in treatment for about what six

35 weeks Four lo six weeks Hes changed MS HANSON It wonldnt even be that long

DR DREW Well hes changed dramatically since when we saw him last

40 time

MS HANSON indistinct oral medication prior to going to indistinct is what I understand

45 DR DREW So I think hes shown significant change and improvement as a

result of treatment I think you ought to keep on the treatment MR NESMITH I will sir Thank you Dr Drew

5 DR DREW With a community health mental health team I dont care where he lives Ifhe likes Id like to live up there with him but I dont need to Ive got birds all around me evidently Im just lucky But you know but hes also talking about coming back and living in town

10 MS HALSEY Absolutely Were in close contact all the time So Im an extra level of support

MR NESMITH Chris has really helped

15 DR DREW I think we all want to work as cooperatively as possible Sorry

MS HALSEY Thats okay I dont take it personally

MS HANSON Were just really representing the psychiatrists

20

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I guess I sort of ifI can ask a question about youve been in the sort of emergency crisis accommodation in the past and that hasnt worked

25 MR NESMITH Its dangerous Like in the Ballarat case someone actually broke into my window while I was sleeping So I caught someone in the middle of climbing into my window Im like What What are you doing

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Have you been in emergency or

30 supportive accommodation in the ACT in the past

MR NESMITH I dont want to because for example this morning I went to Havelock House and then I asked the administration if it was safe First she went like Then she went

35

DR DREW Youre kidding

MR NESMITH Then she went Im much better in the mountain than I am in a position where Im a very sensitive person I dont want people arguing I

40 mean not just arguing They yell They smash things and they scream I dont want that in my life at all

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes So

45 MR NESMITH I would be much happier in the mountain than in that

position Thats why I need to work with housing to

DR DREW But youre pursuing the option of getting your own housing

5 MR NESMITH Yes Thats what I indistinct

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL But the likelihood of that happening in a short period of time

10 MS BATES What Wendell wants its not so much that hes against emergency accommodation What he wants is accommodation where wherever he is its selfcontained Like he has his own bathroom and he has

his own cooking facilities Where he has to share bathrooms and share cooking facilities hes not keen on that because then you have this level of you know

15

MR NESMITH I need a man cave MS BATES He needs a man cave

20 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Because I saw on our notes that perhaps youd been at Samaritan House in the past and that hadnt worked out before

MS MABEY Have you been in Samaritan House

25 MR NESMITH I dont remember I dont think so

MS MABEY Im not aware of that

MR NESMITH I dont think so Like I learned in Ballarat how dangerous

30 crisis accommodation is Ever since Ballarat Ive done everything that I could to stay away from it because I know how it is

MS MABEY Which is why he lives how he lives

35 PRESIDENTMEMBERDANIEL Yes

DR DAVEY Each time he moves he falls out of treatment and he is socially isolated and we go back to square one What Im seeing here is history of him in and out of treatment and not being adequately treated

40

MR NESMITH If you help me Ill stay here

DR DAVEY Wendell thats what Im proposing to help you Im seeing that youre an intelligent capable person who could be so much better on treatment

45 who needs to stay in treatment and who needs to be in regular contact with

people in order to stay well What we have here is an undertreated history where you have been itinerant and you have fallen out of treatment I actually think you should be on an order because I want to see you being happy and healthy for a while

5

I dont care whether you live in a tent either I dont think its the best place for you to live I think youre too young and capable to be socially isolated but you need to be where people can look after you where you can make friends What about your issues about finding a wife Youve been talking about

10 finding a wife

MR NESMITH Im still doing it but I want to do it through the Internet I think thats actually really good because paving a new way for people to meet each other By my putting my heart out on the Internet for the entire world to

15 see eventually Ill get led to that person that like Im famous In the US Im really popular The thing is that will eventually lead to someone who wants what I have to offer So I think in the future its going to happen a lot more often because you can match really really good people together if you just use the Internet to see yourself

20

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Thats not a new concept

MR NESMITH Its not a dating site Its not a dating site Its standing in front of a camera holding the camera pointing back at you and talking to that

25 camera about your life and how you feel about everything and what is meaningful to you and what you hate about the world and what you love about the world Thats how I want to meet my wife Im willing to wait Thats okay Im a very patient person In philosophy weve got we learn patients very well

30

MS BATES May I address the tribunal

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes Were just exploring things

35 MS BATES Yes I can see I think the discussion has been incredibly helpful indistinct Member Davey I can see your concerns and its your concerns Id like to address primarily Its coming down to what kind of treatment would he get on a PTO versus what kind of treatment would he get indistinct

40 DR DAVEY Thats not what concerns me

MS BATES Oh

DR DAVEY I dont think hes going to accept treatment

45

MHl0812 020818 P24

MS BATES Ill come back to your concerns

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Deal with Dr Daveys concerns then come back to mine

5

MS BATES Arguably there really isnt a indistinct in this case Your concern is about the long term and whether or not hell continue to engage and in particular the treatment team being able to engage with him Being able to indistinct if something goes wrong I cant see how a PTO being in place

10 would change any of that and so arguably its not the least restrictive option in this case

The least restrictive option is there not being a psychiatric treatment order and to engage voluntarily I do recognise your concerns but I think in some

15 situations it might be the case that PTO would provide something that not being on a PTO wouldnt provide I cant see how thats the case in this situation

DR DAVEY I can I can see that Wendell knows that he has to attend for

20 treatment and the onus is on him and to come down from the mountain to attend as opposed to people finding him in an undisclosed location I think the other option there is with a PTO ifhe does ifwe do lose him then we can at least call the police as well So I think my concern is that this is very one sided Its putting the treating team in a very difficult position and I want

25 Wendell to have some sort of obligation to come down the mountain

MS MABEY He does that every day Dr Davey

DR DAVEY Into treatment He does while he is under this

30

MS MABEY No he does it every day He has to To get water to get gas for his heater He comes every day Ive been in touch with him every day and he has the same routine every day

35 MR NESMITH indistinct

DR DAVEY indistinct I think thats right for food and for social contact but in order to receive treatment hes very clever Hes done this for the last seven or eight or more years He knows that until weve made this decision

40 that he has to toe the line The history tells me that he hasnt toed the line once hes gone off the treatment order Thats my concern I want him to be well and I want him to function adequately and healthily and happily Up until now he hasnt Thats what you have to convince me about

45 MS BATES While he has had this process hanging over his head arguably

MH10812 020818 P25

like Dr Drew mentioned earlier indistinct he hasnt been under any kind of order since he was released indistinct he has expressed not only verbally but through his actions a willingness to engage He has come down hes been given depot injections which are

5

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL One in hospital and one since discharge

MS BATES Which are invasive Lets not indistinct you know nobody else has to go through that He has expressed his willingness todo that and to

IO continue to do that I note youre looking at the history and that look I cant argue against that There is history thats problematic but on this occasion and this is what we need to be primarily looking at I understand that you need to also look at the history to determine whether or not somebody is going indistinct but primarily in this case he has shown a willingness and expressed

15 a willingness to consent to continue this treatment

I think it would be a far more therapeutic process for him to be engaged voluntarily on this occasion Its also I mean the tribunal has said this before This is your last chance you know This is like Weve given you chances

20 before You cant just keep doing this Eventually youre going to be on a psychiatric treatment order I think given the history the length oftime hes been engaged with I think the previous presentation in the ACT was 2013 Yes

25 I think given that time in between noting that there has been extreme indistinct I think its worthwhile giving him another chance From a legal point of view I really I would argue the indistinct can be fully demonstrated in this case I think which is the key question here But also I think there is a less restrictive option available and I think indistinct in this case

30

DRDAVEY Ifitworks MS BATES Yes

35 DR DAVEY Theres a I 0year history of it not working

MS MABEY Can I ask a question

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL We might adjourn and discuss it unless

40 anyone wants to make any further comments

DR DREW Can I say one other thing Can I suggest that very quickly someone from the treatment team goes with Wendell up to see where he does live and then when you call the police youll know where to send them

45

MHI0S12 020818 P26

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Thats a good idea MS HALSEY I put my hand up for that

5 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL On a sunny day Not a rainy day Does anyone have any other submissions theyd like to make before we adjourn to consider

MS MABEY I just wanted to ask a question because I Im not I didnt read

10 all of the notes but when he was under a treatment order in Queensland PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL On what occasion

MS MABEY I believe it was 2016

15

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL 2016 yes MS MABEY Yes Did he

20 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL It was revoked on 16 June because he said hed take treatment He was discharged on Olanzapine on 7 July 2016 and thats where the records stop

MS MABEY Did you continue treatment after the treatment order

25

MR NESMITH I did yes I actually already told you about this When I went to the US and it was 600 per month I cannot afford that

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Then he came back to

30

MS MABEY How long did you go to the states for

MR NESMITH I was there for six months then I went to Mexico for one year and then I came from Mexico to here

35

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL To Canberra

DR DAVEY Which is when you presented to City Mental Health

40 MR NESMITH Ive been here for four months almost

MS MABEY And theres been concerns about his mental state for that time PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay Ms Bates do you want to say

45 something before were adjourned

MH10812 020818 P27

MS BATES In regards to police even if if somebody is on a PTO I understand having that piece of paper is helpful but you can indistinct issues We believe there is a risk and

5

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Well there has already been contact with the AFP obviously because thats how he was taken to the hospital because of concerns with his behaviour at Centrelink

10 MS BATES So while we can never predict how the police will react in any given situation noting that there has been indistinct incident they would arguably take this one seriously regardless of whether a PTO is in place I think that the police would take it seriously Thank you

15 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Ms Halsey I think we understand your position that we shouldnt make an order

ADJOURNED

20 RESUMED

423 pm

431 pm

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So were resuming matter MH108 of 2012

25 DR DREW Can I say Im going to excuse myself I have another appointment I have to go to but Ive made my position plain to everybody before

MR NESMITH Thank you Dr Drew

30

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Look obviously this is a very difficult decision and in fact the tribunal is not in agreement about it Dr Drew has made his view clear and that he does not think that its appropriate to make the psychiatric treatment order and certainly the most therapeutic situation

35 would be voluntary treatment I can say the tribunal is in agreement in these respects We do think that Mr Nesmith has a mental illness

We do think that without treatment he is likely to do harm to himself serious harm as a result of misadventure or selfneglect and potentially how people

40 may react to him that leads him to risk and that also without treatment his mental state and functioning will seriously deteriorate So were satisfied of those things What the areas of disagreement focus on are the question of whether Mr Nesmith refuses treatment or not I know weve had a lot of conversation about what practical effect a PTO would have In my view thats

45 not particularly relevant Legally it might be relevant in practical terms but its

MHI 0812 020818 P28

not part of the legal test The legal test is actually does he have a mental illness whats the risk if not treated and then this key question is he refusing treatment

5 Both Dr Davies and I are of the view that there should be a treatment order for six months and the reason why is because when we look at those medical records we see a history of a person who continually says to the authorities that he will accept treatment and then it all goes wrong and hes not involved in treatment any more So just for the purposes of remembering that the best

10 predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour the records that we have say that he came selfpresented to a hospital in June 2011 and this was in Ballarat with suicidal ideation At that stage he had not eaten for six days He was quite unwell and he was admitted to hospital

15 The latest record from that 2011 episode was 31 August 2011 when it wrote that two weeks postdischarge he was to move to Western Australia he was referred to the WA Mental Health Service Swan Mental Health He was going to be living with a supportive bunch of friends and everything was going to be wonderful but it didnt work out that way There was no order made because it

20 was all going to be voluntary It didnt work out because we see that in April 2012 actually hes admitted to the ACT Adult Mental Health Unit then hes discharged again voluntary lost to that service

The next thing that happens is he has another admission in Canberra in 2013

25 where he came in as we discussed previously through the Emergency Department Again an opportunity for him to engage voluntarily in treatment for what were satisfied is his mental illness lost to followup treatment Then he ends up in Lismore in 2014 We dont have the records for that but we do have a reference that he says that he spent a week in prison in Grafton I dont

30 know whether thats a reference to being kept in hospital or actually a criminal thing we dont know But whatever we know is he didnt stay in treatment after coming in to treatment in Lismore he was out of it

By 12 April 2016 he is in Queensland He gets admitted after what sounds like

35 a very risky episode at a caravan park where hes making comments about young women and that could have led him to being misunderstood and physically threatened Certainly he was brought in under an emergency order to the hospital He was put on an involuntary treatment order That was revoked on 16 June He was discharged on Olanzapine on 7 July 2016 but

40 thats where the records end because hes been lost to treatment

We are satisfied on the basis of that record that no matter what Mr Nesmith says and how persuasive he is and genuine Mr Nesmith I think youre genuine and so does Dr Davies when you tell us youre going to engage in

45 treatment Its not that we think youre lying to us we think youre absolutely

MHl 0812 020818 P29

honest and genuine but life interferes with that But were confident that with a psychiatric treatment order because you are a good person and a

ruleconscious person you will comply with that and you wont be lost to treatment while that order is in place

5

So were going to make an order for six months and well review that before it expires and we look forward to hearing what your accommodation turns out being like when we review this It might be that youre still living where youre living now because you might choose to do that and thats fine or you might

IO choose to go into other accommodation Thats fine too But whats really important is were ordering that you will continue with the recommended medical treatment for another six months and well hear how thats going at the end of those six months Okay

15 MR NESMITH Thank you

Illness characterized by an elaborate systemlzed delusional system that Is very fixed and possibly on a background of a schzotypal personality disorder with longstanding beliefs and suspicion about several organizations Infiltrating the government social and medical services including the Illuminati Freemasons and Artificial Intelligence Al

Mr Nesmith seems to spend most of his time gathering evidence of the Freemasons activity In Canberra a place he believes Is the Occult Capital of the World He believes the Freemasons do ritualistic and brutal child sacrifices and states he has evidence of this He also spends time recording short films an his phone as part of his evidence and distribution to others to warn them of these organisations Infiltrating society and showing proof for example of Al taking control He also spends time writing emails to various organisations eg AFP to alert thetn of the atrocities of the Freemasons and pleading they take action He presents very earnest and driven to save society from these malevolent organisations and sees himself as a type of saviour He emails and videos he shows us are more dlfflcultto follow and convey a deeper level of disorganization In his thinking

Mr Nesmith states he has been a student of Philosophy for 10 years recently finishing a degree at Murdoch University It does not seem his was worked though he states he Is a successful FilmMaker and has won several awards In Film Festivals overseas It is unclear If Mt Nesmith could hold down any form of employment with the level of his preoccupations and role he has defined for himself In society He also chooses to Isolate himself by camping In Mt Ainslie bush area as a way to avoid the malevolent people he believes Inhabit the city though he has voiced openness to assistancewith more stable housing

Did say he getselevated because he Is passionate and people think this Is a mental 11Mss but challenged societal norms and upset he hasbeen labelled In past as being unwell

Whilst Wendell 1ked to be vey polite and call me mam could smile and be gracious rapport was brittle when he felt under scrutiny challengednot belleved But he contained the rrtab1ty displaying It In more driven proof speech wanting to show evidence on his phone

Tolerated redirection and Interruptions Content of his Interview Included

Described himself asa Philosopher who Integrates mythology eg showing that Peter Pan Is real sociology and other cultural subject to explain the truth about society

Called himself an Award winning fllmmaker with a recent prize at the Socia Uprising Grassroot and Resistance fllm festval in the US Fm was a private reease to avoid censorship called Ivory Heart

He belleves Canberra ls the occult capital of the World

He thinks the Freemasons are a satanic cult that sacrifice children and thathe Grandmaster Is In Canberra He

Is Investgating them documenting them and has proof to show others eg poIce of their crimes and he wants to take aver the Freemasons to save everyone from them

There ls no person he has specifically Identified st looking but states he has all the evidence

He described abizzare belef In a ritual that the Freemasons do icudlligsucking the blood from an artery to use the effects of substances from the adrenal gland for powerhealth

He beeves that Artificial lnte1gence Al lstaking aver the world That Al has integrated Into all our technology and creating synthetic bodies to appear as humans

Wendalshowedusavideopartofwentfor45mins wewatchedabout5mnshecreatedonhlslphone titled War games as proof of this

It was an amateur footage of trees anda Canberra building with a voice over that didnt make much sense but then footage of another phone with a Srtype animation lady answering his questions about the Freemasons Answered seemed autogenerated from a srllce assistant program but Wendall was adamant this was an example of Als capabllites and manevalent Intent

Wendall believes he Is now the head of the 1umlnati who use to be an organisation Intent on taking aver the world as welt but he ftopped this Hence his focus nowon the Freemasons and Al

Wendall also read a long email he sent to to the AFP yesterday detailing his beJefsthat the Freemasons have Infiltrated them and his proof of the Freemasons evil and that they should act etc Although the sentence structure was logical his Ideas were difficult to falaw at times Included a reference to a pineal gland

t addiction and mentioning atrocities without defining them

Also described on a mission looking far his wife that he reference some attachment spiritually at birth and It Is his questtaflnd her Tattoo an chest was a name he has given her but yet ta find her real name Also showed various tattoos that had rellgous or other speca significance In his various quests

I tried to explore with Wendel ciny past psychiatric treatmentexperiences

He states he hasbeen Imprisoned In Canberra Grafton and 12 other psychiatric hospitals In Australa He beleves this was due ta trying to censor him Adamant he has never had mental health problems

He hashad oanzapne In the past and found It awful very sedatingflattening and felt ft was done with malevolent Intent

He states risperldone was even worse but didnt give specifcs as started to get Irritable about me watching to push medications an him

Wont consider anything new eg Abllify as does notbelieve he needs It and thinks we are pushing medication to censor him or for some other ill Intent or for our benefitgain

only medication he would accept isXanax for when he felt he need to restslow down Explained rarely

prescribed now and why Seemed to accept this and did not push for script

DA

Wendell denies any ict drug use eg cannabis Jee ecstacy synthetics

However he states hebuys herbsfrom the chemist and smokes those sometimes NII acoho

Nicotine stains noted on fingers

Medical

nil medical history of note disclosed states he Isvery healthy flt and strong nll physical complaintsconcerns

Agrees he hasnt had blood tests for a Jong time and agreeable to have some done

Agreeable to finding a GP

Family

WendeI wasnt keen to talk about this family He states his parents are In USA

He has not contacted them for years as they do notbelieve In what he is doing

Same with his one blologca brother Ricky

Also states his parents adopted 2731 children around the world

Friends

states he has a few close friends but did not want to elaborate

Risk

Wendell is Intent on finding the Freemasons and confronting people If he suspects that are them or to tel them his views about needing to be warnedsaved He agreed some people wont listen to him but that he had to try There was no single person he had Identified yet in hisevidence I dont know yet I am stlll

looking

He would like to challenge the grandmaster In hand to hand combat but no way would I klIhurt him I am a pacifist IJust want to be the new leader of the Freemasons Ike I did with the 1lumlnati His proof of leadership of the 1luminati was not from a combat challenge but an email he sent to a princess which he showed usand dldnt make much sense and I noted emall address had rebounded as undelivered

He denes any thought or Intent to hurt someone even if he felt for example they had sacrificed children

He denied any problems with poIce and has never been aggressivethreatened people He was upset that I asked about this as It went against his ethicsmorals

Wendells biggest current risk Is potentially aggravating others with his driven beJefs and conflict arising Misadventure from his homelessness and living in a tent in a harsh approaching winter could be a problem

There ls also the past risk Incident when he Inserted a speaker wire Into his penis 2013 and the possbty of further Incidents if based on a delusional belief

Chronic risks for Wendell is a poor prognosis and recovery the longer a psychotic Illness is left untreated that any medca contributors to his psychosis have yet to be Investigated and that he likely to stay unemployed Itinerant and on the fringe

It Is unknown If he would ever act violently based on his deusans There is not enough past known history try and quanttate risk other than his psychotic Illness Js a risk factor

Cooperative started and finished Interview very polte pleasant calng me mam because I am pote and say that to everyone However more Irrtable and driven during Interview when taking about his beliefs and became quite angry but contained taking about past Imprisonment conspiracies being censored etc Irritable about past mental health treatment

No Insight Into having a mental illness rather that it Is other people who are unwell If they dont believe his proof evidence etc WIii not trial any medlcotion as he belleves he Is well and that any medication for his mental health is medical doctors tryingto censor him or forsome other ill intent or for our benefitgain

Relevant Past History

Mr Nesmith has only had two prior contact periods with our Service

The first was In April 2012 referred by GP resulting In a short involuntary PSU acute adult psychiatric ward admission Canberra Hospital

The referral from GP stated Ile presented to me with some magca thinkingno auditory hallucinations he has no friends and claimed to be living on the mountain There Is a family history of schizoid personality disorder I believe he has schzotypa personality disorder

He was seen by CATT clinicians with Mr Nesmith agreeable to coming to hospital for an assessment but he had

told CATT that our system wfll not help that this is the 2 in a psychiatric ward your doctors will diagnose me as either schizophrenia or schzotypa they will force medication on me and push their own Ideal of what a bWiRAAtt0rs1JnrucbsurIJiJM11LbernpreGBwr11JthM0dribG0t1dftiGGSthathwu_gJtabe11tJJlhCJ 1nP1wilkb

me your systems do not help BUT no longer care about anything so thefoliles of your society wlil have to deal with its creation ME OR I end my life Your choice I no longer care

Mr Nesmith was assessed by a psychiatrist Dr J cubis who thought he had a likely psychotic illness or schlzotypal personality disorder Mr Nesmith was admitted to PSU acute adult mental health unit on 28th April 5th May 2012 Mr Nesmith did not talk or cooperate much with the admission and as he was not floridly psychotic the team could not uphold a PTO so he was discharged and lost contact with services

The second contact was brief in 2013 by the psychiatry cL Canberra HospItal team after a bizarre Incident where he had inserted speaker wire Into his penis requiring surgical Intervention Surgical team referred to psychiatry CL as his speech was hard to follow he had odd behavioursbeliefs and seemed quite paranoid He was lnltlally placed on an ED7 as presented psychotic with thought disorder and grandiose But this was taken off a few days later as he presented more settled with no evidence of psychosis though his odd and eccentric personality paranoid themes and alternate lifestyle camping In busliland near Mt Ainslie to avoid

people was noted at the time He was hence discharged and not seen again hY our services until this year

When asked about this hospital Incident r cently Mr Nesmith talked about being embarrassed It had happened and that It was sexual experimentation that went horribly wrong as he wanting to try and Increase sexual stimulation

In regards to other psychiatric presentations Mr Nesmith has spoken about being locked up In hospitals in various places In NSW at least on 2 occasions With him believing he was being censored for his beliefs and part of a greater conspiracy and coverup He was reluctant to give details of his time In hospital or precise locations He could 11st by name several antlpsychotlcs used olanzapine risperidone quetlaplne and the awful side effects experienced adding to his negative experience It does not seem he has ever taken anlpsychotlcs longterm only In restrictive environments

There Is no known history of his earlier years In the US before he moved to Australia He states he Is estranged from his us parents and siblings because they 11dont believe In my cause He Is adamant he does not want contact with them We have not found any longerterm friend or contact for any collateral history alas

Describe and explain your overall assessment referring to the factors above and to the principles of decisionmaking capacity set out In section 8 see Glossary

fllr Nesmith does not believe his has a mental Illness and that anyone who questions his beliefs or

Jntmtlqlis Isp_artotthewlgespJe4clcensorshlpffed coverup2 JiealQiellevesmgdlcal staff enforce__

their own views of societal norms and llness In a biased way and with IllIntent Any discussion of mental Illness or offer of antlpsychotlc medication Is seen as us being Judgemental dismissive and at worse part of the c nsplracy to keep him from doing hls tasks of saving humanity from various threats He has a hint of Insight than he can get busy and elevated but only wants Xanax alprazolam to help slow him down He believes this Is part of his excitable personality style and not a sign of a mood or psychotic disorder The notion ofgong to hospital for treatment Is also seen as the ultimate punishment alas and he would find this very traumatic and coercive and further proof of the medical establishments malevolence This belief ls also based on real past negative experiences with Involuntary psychiatric admissions and side effects from several antipsychotics that he reports

REFUSAL

6 Does the person refuse to receive treatment care or support or If the person has decisionmaking capacity refuse to consent to treatment care or support

IBlYos D No If yes describe what the person does andor says that constitutes refusal

Mr Nesmith s refusing to trial any antlpsychotc medication due to his conviction that he does not have a mental Illness and that any treatment will be unjust unfounded and cause harm

Page 9 of 14

Illness or mental disorder IBJYes No

Is the person suffering or likely to suffer serious mental or physical deterioration because of the mental Illness or mental disorder IBJYes No

Jfyes explain your reasons for this opinion

Risk prediction is a fraught area as clinicians cannot be precise or quantltate risk given the variables and unpredictable nature of peoples behaviour and their environments

However the risks to Mr Nesmith Include that the longer he Is left with an untreated psychotic Illness the worse his prognosis and quality of recovery that could have devastating Impacts on his ability to work have relationships Jive and function In society There Is a potential risk of him falsely Identifying a community member as the grandmaster of the Freemasons based on a delusion and conflict arising with possible violent sequelae although there Is no past history of violent altercations yet that we know of His lntlnerant and secretlv lifestyle limits any corroborative history He may be at risk of angering others with his investigations and misadventure There are risks around camping In the bush regions If he was to have physical health issues or not have enough gear for w rmth Personal safety and security Is also problematic

Is is not known if Mr Nesmith would selfharm If he became overwhelmed by his predicament and fate of the world There was the past lncldeht of Inserting a wire Into his penis which may have been due

TREATMENT

8 What treatment care or support Is proposed If a treatment plan is prepared it may be attached to this form

It Is unlikely given his lack of Insight that Mr Nesmith would agree to trial an oral antlpsychotlc In the community and be adherent Hence a treatment trial would Involve a hospital environment with the goals of starting an oral antlpsychotlc eg pallperldone or arlplprazole and switching to a depot preparation Several weeks would be required and the Inpatient setting choices Include the Acute Adult Mental Health Unit at Canberra Hospital or possibly a rehabilitat1on facility that may be less stressful for him

Created By Dr Caroline Flynn Registrar Printed By Dr Caroline Flynn Registrar

Page 10 of 14

Community followup would Include regular contact with a casemanager and doctor psychological therapy If desired and assistance linking to services for housing and other goals he may have In his recovery eg further study or work

9 Why or how will treatment care or support be likely to reduce harm or deterioration or result in an Improvement to the persons condltloni

It Is hoped thut Mr Nesmlths delusional preoccupations are reversible and that with treatment he would be able to not be so consumed In saving the world collect evidence confronting organisations etc and transfer his Intellect and creativity to other pursuits that hopefully provide Joy fulfillment and security and not place him at risk The risks associated with chronic mental Illness would hopefully be reduced and his quality of life Improved There Is a possibility that he Is estranged from his US family

due to delusional beliefs and this could potentially be healed and Increase his supports

10 WhY cant the treatment care or support f5e adequafoly prov1aedWlcfflilss r sMdlo11 al Elie leed6111

ofch lce nd movement oTth persri

Primarily because Mr Nesmith wlll not consent to treatment in the community setting and Is likely to disengage from our services entirely If he feels we are a threat to his liberty Any reasonable treatment trial wilt Involve at least 48 weeks of adequate dose medication

Good morning

Kell Thomas has uploaded hospital notes from both Ballarat and Cairns hospitals please advise if you want these emailed to you

Wendell has been engaging with City mental health accepting treatment and psychiatric review to avoid further

torture ie going back to hospital Im sure the CM will attend the hearing and provide the Tribunal with further information as requested

Impression after psychiatric review on 31718

Remains very fixed around his beliefs but seems less driven then prior to hospitalization Very grandiose

No insight that he has a psychotic illness

Is agreeing to have treatment because of fears of further torture eg going back to hospital Engagement will continue to be fraught with this tension but currently was able to establish good rapport today

Ongoing plan

Continue olanzapine depot Consider dose increase

Need to arrange new GP Interchange Needs to start process of DSP Housing support need to explore all emergencytemporary housing options

Centrelink Certificate dated until midoctober diagnosis schizophrenia see scanned copy Case manager to look into psychological and other support

I hope this is of some assistance to the Tribunal Regards

7 In an appeal by way ofreview under s 82b of the ACAT Act

the Appellant must demonstrate an eTor of fact or law or an erroneous exercise of discretion and

the Appeal Tribunal may receive futther evidence1

8 The Respondent submits that the factors relevant to determining whether to admit further evidence in an appeal by way ofreview include

a Whether exceptional circumstances exist that wairnnt the admission offu1ther evidence in light of the need for finality in litigation2 The exceptional circutnstances test was stated by the High Court in Fox v Percy 2003 214 CLR 118 at 22 in respect of appeals to the NSW Supreme Coutt It has been adopted in respect of appeals within ACAT in appellate decisions of the Tribunal and the ACT Supreme Court3

b Whether the further evidence is relevant to the grout1ds of appeal in that it will assist the Appeal Tribunal to decide whether there was any eToi in the decision under review4 This may include considering

i whether the evidence relates to facts that existed at the time the decision under appeal was made as evidence that goes to facts that postdate the decision is less likely to be relevant to whether there was any e1Tor in the decision5 and

ii whether the evidence is in the nature of an expert opinion on relevant issues6 a11d

c Whether the paity seeking leave to present the futther evidence had the oppottunity to present that evidence at the hearing at first instance or put another way whether there was any breach of procedural fairness to the patty at

first instance7 and

d Whether the admission of the fu1ther evidence would require even futther evidence still to properly assess the weight to be afforded to it for example

9 The Appellants website contains a substantial volume of material He has not identified how auy or all of this material relates to the grounds of appeal stated in his Application for Appeal filed on 7 September 2018

ACT Chief Psychiatrist

Respondent

RESPONDENTS SUBMISSIONS

1 The ACT Chief Psychiatrist Respondent seeks orders that the appeal be dismissed and the Tribunals decision of2 August 2018 be confirmed

Background

2 On 2 August 2018 the Tribunal the Original Tribunal made a Psychiatric Treatment Order PTO in relation to the Appellant for a period of 6 months following hearings on 12 July 2018 and 2 August 20181

3 The Tribunals power to make a PTO is set out ins 58 of the Mental Health Act 2015

Mental Health Act as follows

58 Psychiatric treatment order

I This section applies to

a a person assessed under an assessment order or

b a person in relation to whom an application for a mental health order has been made

under part 52 or

c a person in relation to whom an application for a forensic mental health order has been made under division 712 or

d a person required by a court to submit to the jurisdiction of the ACAT nuder the Crimes Act part 13 or the Crimes Act 1914 Cwlth patt IB

2 The ACAT may make a psychiatric treatment order in relation to the person if

a the person has a mental illness and

b eithe1

i the person does not have decisionmaking capacity to consent to the treatment care or

support and refuses to receive the heatment care or support or

ii the person has decisionmaking capacity to consent to the treatment care or support

but refuses to consent and

c the ACAT believes on reasonable grounds that because of the mental illness the

person

i is doing or is likely to do serious harm to themself or someone else or

ii is suffering or is likely to suffer serious mental or physical deterioration and

1 The Application for a PTO in respect of the Appellant MH 1082012 first came before the Tribunal prior to 12 July 20 I8 but was adjourned to that date so the Appellant could be present Transcript 12 July 2018

pp 34

d in relation to a person mentioned in paragraph b iithe ACAT is satisfied that the harm or deterioration or likely harm or deterioration mentioned in paragraph c is of such a serious nature that it outweighs the persons right to refuse to consent and

e the ACAT is satisfied that psychiatric treatment care or support is likelyto

i reduce the harm or deterioration or the likelihood of the harm or deterioration mentioned in paragraph c or

ii result in an improvement in the persons psychiatric condition and

f if an application has been made for a forensic mental health orderthe ACAT is satisfied that a psychiatric treatment order should be made instead and

g the ACAT is satisfied that the treatment care or supp01t to be provided under the psychiatric treatment order cannot be adequately provided in another way that would involve less restriction of the freedom of choice and movement of the person

4 The Appellant is a person in respect of whom a PTO may be made under s 581b The findings of the Original Tribunal as set out in its Statement dated 2 August 2018 match closely the te1ms of s 582 of the Mental Health Act In particular the Original Tribunal found that

the Appellant has a mental illness

the Appellant does not have decisionmalcing capacity to consent to the treatment care or support proposed for him

the Appellant refused the treatment proposed for him

because although he says he will accept treatment and in the very recent past has been accepting treatment he has a 7 year history of ceasing treatment after advising health authorities he will continue with treatment The Tribunal considers his cunent compliance with treatment is of a short duration and against the extensive history is of the view that he refuses treatment Statement aiv

there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Appellant because of his mental illness

o is likely to do serious haim to himself as a result of misadventure or selfneglect when unwell and

o is likely to suffer serious deterioration of his mental state and functioning if untreated

psychiatric treatment care or support is likely to reduce the likelihood ofhaim or deterioration and is likely to result in an improvement of the Appellants psychiatric condition and

the treatment proposed under the PTO could not be adequately provided in another way that would involve less restriction of the Appellants freedom of choice and movement

5 The Original Tribunals decision was made by majority The Psychiatrist Member was of the view that a PTO should not be made

6 The documentary evidence before the Original Tribunal comprised

the application for a PTO by Dr Emma Glanville Consultant Psychiatrist as delegate or nominee of the Chief Psychiatrist dated 19 June 2018 and

records obtained from the Chief Psychiatrist from mental health services in Victoria Ballarat and QLD Caims in respect of the Appellants prior admissions in those jurisdictions

medications19 Accordingly on 19 June 2018 an application for a PTO was made on behalf of the Chief Psychiatrist

17 On 4 July 2018 the Appellant was admitted to the Adult Mental Health Unit at TCH under an emergency assessment order after displaying highly agitated and aggressive behaviours towards staff at a Centrelinlc office which had resulted in police being called20 On his admission he was agitated aggressive manic and highly labile and he had intense very wellsystemised delusional beliefs21 He initially Iefused medication but was given intramuscular antipsychotics and subsequently agreed to talce an injection of Olanzapine His presentation was much improved by the first hearing before the Original Tribunal on 12 July 201822 On 17 July 2018 the Appellant was discharged from TCH

18 On 2 August 2018 the Original Tribunal made the PTO

19 On 7 September 2018 the Appellant filed an Application for Appeal together with an application to extend the time for lodging an appeal which was granted by consent

20 The Appellant has not filed any further documents in support of his appeal although he has indicated he wishes to tender new evidence see below

Appellants grounds of appeal

21 The Appellants grounds of appeal state that the Original Tribunal erred in making the PTO because there was insufficient evidence or no evidence before the Original Tribunal to satisfy the following requirements of s 582 of the Mental Health Act

that the Appellant was refusing treatment s 582biiGround 1 andor

that the Appellant was a serious risk to himself or others or that he was at risk of deterioration s 582ci and iiGround 2

Respondents submissions on admission of new evidence

22 The Respondent does not seek to rely on new evidence at the appeal hearing

23 The Appellant indicated by emails dated 25 and 26 October 2018 to the Tribunal that he wishes to submit his website nesmithnet in particular the section on Rebirthing into evidence on appeal

24 The Respondent reiterates its submission of2 November 2018 that new evidence should only be admitted in an appeal by way of rehearing under s 82b of the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2008 ACAT Act in exceptional circumstances The Appellant has not identified exceptional circumstances that warrant the admission of the material on the Rebirthing section of the website as new evidence on appeal

25 The material on the Appellants website to the extent reviewed by the Respondent traverses a range of themes most of which have no apparent relevance to his appeal including for example explanations by the Appellant of his practices in making videos animated footage concerning religious themes and records of his interactions with Facebook In paiis the website discloses the Appellants experiences of mental health treatment and his objections to the mental health system and services

26 The Tribunal should only admit new evidence where it is relevant meaning that it could rationally affect directly or indirectly the assessment of theprobability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding23 The material on the Appellants website even insofai as it concerns the mental health system is not likely to rationally affect the Tribunals assessment of whether any of the grounds of appeal me made out The fact that the Appellant had objections to mental health treatment especially as an inpatient was apparent on the evidence before the Original T1ibunal and his historic noncompliance with treatment was a reason for the making of the PTO The website material does not add to this in a new or substantial way The Respondent submits that it is for the Appellant to aiticulate how the website material relates specifically to his grounds of appeal beyond generalised asseiiions that it exposes c01Tuption and evil in the mental health system

27 No breach of procedural fairness arises to the Appellant if the material is not admitted Much of the material pmp01is to predate the Original Tribunals decision The Appellant could have sought to tender this material at first instance but he did not do so To the extent that it postdates the Original Tribunals decision it is unlikely to be capable of revealing any error in that decision24

28 The Respondent accordingly submits that the Tribunal should not admit the Appellants website in whole or in part into evidence on the appeal

29 In the alternative should the Appellants website in whole or in paii be admitted into evidence the Respondent submits that it does not demonstrate any error of fact or law in the decision of the original Tribunal To the contraiy the Appellants website is consistent with the Tribunals findings that he has a mental illness and he is not inclined to volnntaiily consent to treatment

Respondents submissions on grounds of appeal

Overview

30 It is axiomatic that the Tribunal is one oflimited jurisdiction defined by statute

31 It is axiomatic that a right of appeal depends on the te1ms of the statute

32 Section 79 of the ACAT Act confers a right on a paiiy to a decision by the Tribunal at first instance to appeal from such a decision but only on a question of fact or law

23 Evidence Act 2011 s 551

24 In the matter of AB Appeal 2018 ACAT 18 AB 22232526

33 Section 82 confers a discretion on the Appeal Tribunal to determine whether an appeal made under section 79 should be dealt with as a new application or as a review

34 The jurisdiction or authority of the Appeal Tribunal is confined to matters raising a question of fact or law and that it must therefore be satisfied that a question of fact or law is identified before it proceeds to consider how to deal with an appeal

1 section 79 must be satisfied before section 82 can be applied and

2 section 82 must be applied with regard to the te1ms and effect of section 79

JUlisdiction

35 The jurisdiction of the Tribunal in an appeal has been the subject of close consideration in previous decisions of the Tribunal and in several decisions of the Supreme Court

36 A party to an application decided by the Tribunal an original application has a right to appeal the decision to the Tribunal which we describe as an Appeal Tribunal but it is not a right to appeal at largeit is aright to appeal on a question of fact or law25

37 What may be a question of fact or law has been the subject of extensive consideration in a number of decisions The principles were summarised by Refshauge J in City Hill Ltd ACN 064 633 558 v ACT Planning and Land Authority Anor 2015 ACTSC 40 who indicated that a question of fact or law should be formulated in a way that makes very clear what the question oflaw is that arose in the appeal and not either a question that may be one of fact or of mixed fact and law or that requires a broad inquiry into the constrnction and operation of legislation none of which are questions of law26

38 His Honour later noted that while the requirement to identify a question of fact or law was an important consideration in the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal on an appeal there was no particular form that a question should talce it was sufficient that there be a clear and precise identification of a question in a meaningful and intelligible way27 Conversely if the grounds of an application do not truly raise a question of fact or law the defect cannot be cured by using plnases like did the tribunal ell or was it open28

39 The question of fact or law is not only an important factor in determining jurisdiction or the authority to decide an application it is a key factor in the exercise of jurisdiction The question of fact or law ultimately determines the very subject matter of the appeal29

40 Accordingly it is clear that in an appeal by way of review under s 82b of the ACAT Act the Appellant must demonstrate an e11or of fact or law which may include an erroneous exercise of discretion30 As a previous Appeal Tribunal has observed

The appellant cannot merely request the reexercise of a discretion The purpose of the appeal process is not to allow an applicant to try and have a matter reheard because they do not like the previous decision If that were so there would be no point in the original hearing31

A question of fact or a question of law

41 The distinction between questions of fact and law can be vexed and there is no one universal test32 The distinction is arguably not critical when an appeal may be brought on questions of fact or law33 However the following general principles are relevant to the present case

42 The conect construction of a statutory provision is a question of law34 The question of whether there was no evidence to make a paiticular finding of fact is also one of law35 The question of whether facts fully found fall within a statutory provision properly construed is generally a question of law36 However where a statutory provision uses words according to their ordinary meaning as opposed to a technical or specialised meaning and the question is whether facts as found fall within the ordinaiy meaning and where it is reasonably open to hold that they do ie where there is no one correct answer then the question of whether they do or not is one offact37

This appeal

43 An appeal does not automatically proceed as a fresh application38 However principles appear not to have been established to detennine when an application can so proceed

44 The respondent submits the conect approach to be taken in applying these provisions is that which was suggested in The Medical Practitioner and the Act Medical Board Occupational Discipline 2010 ACAT 63 In that case the Appeal Tribunal refe1rnd tothe Coal andAllied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission 2000 203 CLR 194 at 203 In Coal and Allied Operations the High Court examined a provision in a statute which permitted appeal from a vaiiety of different decisions

45 The approach in Coal and Allied Operations has been followed in other decisions39

46 Three different types of appeal were considered

1 appeal in the strict sense

2 appeal by way of rehearing and

3 appeal by way of a hearing de nova

47 The nature of the appeal in a given case was said to depend on the terms of the statute conferring the appeal right the extent of discretion available within the decision making power and the capacity or determination of the appeal body to receive new evidence

48 For present pmposes an appeal in a strict sense 1 and an appeal by way ofrehearing 2 would involve handling an appeal as a review under s 82 of the ACAT Act A hearing de nova 3 would involve handling an appeal as a fresh application

49 The respondent submits that section s 79 and 82 properly construed have the effect that an appeal will ordinarily be conducted as a review of pait or all of the decision save in the case where the interests of justice or effective and timely handling of the application suggest that it should be conducted as an appeal by way of rehearing

50 Where a question of fact or law has been identified sufficiently within the application a choice between these alternatives might be made where for exainple the matter raised is a mixed question of fact and law which is more conveniently addressed by rehearing

51 It is only in exceptional cases that an appeal would be heard as an appeal de novo Without conceding the issue a choice might be made to hear an appeal de novo where there is an extraordinary matrix oflegal and factual issues andor allegations offtaud40

52 Whether it is dealt with as an appeal in the strict sense or an appeal by way of rehearing or indeed as a review in the strict sense in which that expression is ordinarily used the role of the Appeal Tribunal is to dete1mine whether the decision of the Original Tribunal is wrong because it fell into an error of law made a finding of fact that is clearly wrnng or exercised a discretion on a wrong principle or in a way that is clearly wrong41 Prnper scmtiny is apprnpriate the Appeal T1ibmtal must conduct a real review of the trial and the reasons of the tribmtal of first instance However the Appeal Tribunal must give proper allowance to the advantage of the comt of first instance or an 01iginal tribmtal who saw and heard the witnesses so that ordinarily facts fomtd based on the assessment ofwihtesses will not lightly be oveiturned42

53 Where the original decision involves the exercise of a discretion theprinciples in House v King 1936 55 CLR 499 are applicable It is not enough for an appellate tribunal to conclude that it would have taken a different course from the original tribunal What

39 Turnbull v New South Wales Medical Board 1976 2 NSWLR281 which was approved by the High Court in Lacey v AttorneyGeneral of Queensland 201I 242 CLR 573 and see in particular Theodoreas v Nexus Projects Pty Ltd 2009 ACTSC 149 ODonnell v Environment Protection Authority 2012 ACTSC 140

must be evident is that some error has been made in exercising the discretion such as when the tribunal acts on a wrong principle or mistaken fact takes hrnlevant matters into consideration or otherwise makes a decision that is w1reasonable or plainly unjust43 A decision is discretionary where it involves the application of a general standard to the facts found in which there is room for value judgments and reasonable differences of opinion44

54 Ordinarily there are linlited grounds on which one may appeal in relation to evidence While one may appeal onthe basis that there was no evidence or no probative evidence on a paiticular matter before the decision maker one may not appeal merely on the basis that the decision was against the evidence or against the weight of evidence45

55 One may not appeal merely on the basis of a disagreement about the findings of fact To succeed in an appeal on a question of fact the appellant must demonstrate that the original tribunal relied on on evidence that did not have a character of reliability and reasonable substance and it would be sufficient to show that the evidence that was tenuous or inherently weak or vague46 Alternatively if the appellant caimot identify a defect in the evidence before the original tribunal the appellant must demonstrate that the conclusions drawn from the evidence were glfilingly inlprobable or contraiy to compelling inferences47

These grounds

56 The Appellant aigues that there was insufficient evidence to engages 582bii and s 582c of the Mental Health Act or put another way that the facts as found by the Original Tribunal do not fall within the tenns of those provisions The Respondent submits that the words ins 582bii ands 582c of the Mental Health Act bear their ordinaiy meanmg and it was reasonably open for the Original Tribunal to find as it did that the Appellants case falls within these provisions Grounds I and 2 of the appeal therefore principally involve questions of fact

Appellants refusal of treatments 582bi Ground 1

57 The Original Tribunal fotmd that the Appellant refused treatment pursuant to s 582bi of the Mental Health Act

58 The Original Tribunal made this finding having considered the clear and repeated statements of the Appellant that he would comply with treatment48 as well as the evidence that he was at that time engagh1g voluntarily with mental health services following his discharge from TCH49 However the O1iginal Tribunal considered his

cunent compliance to be of sho1t duration in light of his history since at least 2011 of ceasing treatment after advising health authorities that he would continueso

59 The Respondent submits that this finding was reasonably open to the Original Tribunal as a matter of both fact and law and it should not be disturbed

60 The Respondent submits that the assessment of whether a person is refusing treatment under s 582bi cannot be solely subjective based on the persons stated intentions at or prior to the hearing for the mental health order It must be objective and take into account evidence that points towards the person being compliant or noncompliant as a matter of fact

61 In the recent matter of BC Mental Health 2018 ACAT 67 the Tribunal adopted this approach and made a PTO notwithstanding evidence that the person in question was compliant with his treatment regime and expressed willingness to take medication51 The person did not appear to have a history of noncompliance and he had a network of family and other suppmt52 The Tribunal determined that he refused treatment on the basis that he did not agree with his psychiatrists mental illness and he indicated that he would not reliably take medication if he disagreed with the diagnosis53

62 In the present case the Respondent submits that there are even stronger grounds for the Original Tribunal to take the view that the Appellant refused treatment The evidence before the Original Tribunal showed that

the Appellant had no insight into his mental illness to the point that he did not accept that he had a mental illness54

the Appellant had recently and repeatedly refused medication for example on 6 June 201855 and 4 July 201856 and when indicating his willingness to talce medication he stated he would take oral medication but he hated needles57

the Appellants recent compliance with treatment appeared to be on the basis that it was the lesser of two evils as he wished to avoid going back to hospital rather than as a result of genuine insight into his illness58

the Appellant had a history of being discharged from hospital psychiatric wards on the expectation that he would continue treatment voluntarily but each time he quickly lost contact with services Since 2011 this had occuned three times in Canberra once in Ballarat once in Caims and once in Grafton or Lismore

This pattem meant that he had never taken antipsychotics longte1m outside restrictive environments59 and

the Appellant was at a higher than normal risk of noncompliance as he had no fixed address and so it would be difficult to follow up with him if he missed appointments 60

63 This evidence was reliable and had reasonable substance it was not tenuous or inherently wealc or vague This evidence was properly tested The Appellant was legally represented and he gave evidence In particular the Appellant was provided with the oppmtunity to comment on the Original Tribunals concerns about his compliance He gave evidence that the reasons he did not continue with treatment in the past included that he was not able to afford the medication when he was in the US61 and that when he

moved interstate it was difficult to connect with mental health services as he had to prioritise basic needs like finding food62

64 The Original Tribunal heard argument both for and against the malcing of a PTO His legal representative and the Public Advocate made submissions to the effect that a PTO should not be made The Original Tribunal described its decision as a very difficult decision and it was made by majority63 Thus the Original Tribunal reached its conclusions based on a thorough and careful review of the totality of evidence The Original Tribunal was entitled to weigh this evidence and decide that on balance the Appellant would not accept treatment if a PTO were not in place64 and therefore that he refused treatment within the meaning of s 582bi of the Mental Health Act

65 The Appeal Tribunal should give proper allowance to the Original Tribunals evidentiary advantage and not ove1tum this decision lightly merely because another decision may also have been reasonable on the facts The Respondent submits that the Appellant has not demonstrated any enor in the original Tribunals reasoning or findings

Appellants risk of deterioration or harm to himself or others s 582c Ground 2

66 The Original Tribunal was unanimous in finding that both criteria ins 582ci and

ii of the Mental Health Act were met65 These criteria are alternatives Accordingly the Appellant would need to demonstrate that the Tribunal was in error on both findings for his appeal to succeed66

67 The Respondent submits that s 582ci and ii of the Mental Health Act involve the exercise of a discretion as these provisions involve the application of general standards serious harm or serious deterioration and value judgments in respect of which

reasonable minds may differ Accordingly the principles in House v The King apply and restraint is required in disturbing the decision on appeal67

Serious harm to himselfs 582ci

68 The Original Tribunal found that the Appellant was likely to do serious harm to himself under s 582ci of the Mental Health Act as a result of misadventure or selfneglect when unwell The te1m ha1m in s582ci is not to be given a narrow meaning It may include for example reputational harm as well as physical or financial haim68

69 The Original Tribunal was persuaded that the Appellant was at risk of harm because his strong and delusional belief system might bring him into conflict with others69 There was evidence of this occurring in the past including the incident on 4 July 2018 at the Centrelinlc office and the Appellants risky behaviours in the caravan paiIc near Cairns

in April 2016 as well as evidence that the Appellant had contacts with the AFP while in Canbe1rn in 2012201370 which indicates that his behaviour was bringing him to the

attention of others More generally the Appellants belief system includes features that

may generate conflict including that he is on a mission to confront and expose the Freemasons71

70 The Original Tribunal also heard evidence indicatirig a propensity of the Appellant to selfneglect when he was unwell including that upon his arrival in Ballaiat in 2011 he had not eaten for 6 days72

71 The Respondent submits that it was reasonably open to the Original Tribunal to find that the Appellant was at risk of harm pursuantto s 582ci of the Mental Health Act on the basis of the above evidence The Appellant has not demonstrated any e1ror in the Original Tribunals reasoning or findings

Serious deterioration of his mental state s 582cii

72 The Original Tribunal accepted the evidence from mental health professionals that the Appellant was likely to suffer serious mental deterioration if he were not treated73 The

Respondent submits that there was little or no evidence to warrant a contrary finding The Original Tribunals reliance on this evidence is therefore without error

Conclusion on Ground 2

73 The Appellant has not demonstrated any enor in the Original Tribunals reasoning or findings In particular the Appellant has not shown as would be required to disturb a discretionary decision that the Original Tribunal

a acted on a wrong principle

b allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide the decision

c mistook the facts

d did not take into account some material consideration or

e if it is not apparent how it reached its decision the decision on the facts was unreasonable or plainly unjust and the Original Tribunal failed to properly exercise the discretion74

74 The Original Tribunal reached a careful and considered decision that the Appellant was at risk of sedous haim to himself or serious deterioration This decision was plainly open on the evidence

Conclusion

75 The Respondent submits the appeal discloses no error of fact or law in the decision of the Original Tribunal and it should be dismissed

Please see full assessment by Jon Wells for more detailed information

PC

Brought in by CATT after Ainslie Village worker notified CATT was worried about increasing mention

bout suicide

HPC and past psych Hx

full extent unclear but dropped out of uni estranged from family

had psych admission in VIC for 6 weeks he thinks it hasnt helped at all meds were not helpful has been living in Canberra for about a year some of that time on Mt Ainslie in a tent writing philosophical texts

grandiose delusional context in this having created his own religion talking to God contemplating suicide

Medical

denies any medical illness signs that he is strong says no allergies

refused all medical exams ECG blood tests

drugs have not been mentioned in any former reports mental state seems to be relatively stable over time

MSE

v mg man of stated age

L1ssed in outdoor clothes slightly disheveled with moderately strong body odour

only communicating by signing writing on notepad and playing prerecorded messages on his phone which seem to have been prewritten before recording spoken with slight American accent

some eye contact

at first cooperative sat down in armchair opposite me and played his phone message Then when I asked him how long the message is going to be after some minutes he became angry wrote f you on his notepad went back to bed pulled blanket over his head continued to communicate by signing though This was only a brief episode and soon he was as before remained calm and did not threaten us not agitated

no cognitve disturbance noted however not formally tested incl orientation

no FTD noted however difficult to assess while mute internet page quite well structured phone message as well

thought content philosophical about meaning of life not being loved enough how God could create

something special like him and then not use him I am like an unused solar panel not connected to the grid contemplating suicide as option no clear plan to our knowledge

perceptions unclear mood unclear

affect at first quite restricted and guarded then slightly dysphoric

risk mention of suicide as option in his messages no obvious risk to others

insight and judgement some insight in mental disorder some weeks ago thought he might have schizotypal PD however does not think he has schizophrenia judgement seems impaired

28042012 0631 AM File Note Night report Completed 28042012 0641 AM On ED3 awaiting a HOU bed

Wendall has been noted to have sleep well on all observational rounds

He remained on MHAU overnight as he was deemed to need a HOU bed rather than an LOU and AMHU reported that only male LOU beds were available This was not true as 2 HOU beds were apparently empty

No bed was available to him due to the bed cap having been reached

At no time during his stay has he spoken to me He has communicated by writing on paper

F l Assessment New

D Client has been communicating openly this shift

Early in the shift author spent one hour with Wendell in his room and he was very happy to engage He presents as a very well spoken and intelligent man older than stated age Extremely thin with a few tattoos on his body Client speaks with a slight American accent speech slightly rapid conversations difficult to interrupt at times Using good eye contact appropriate body language Wendell was discussing his past states he was previously married in Western Australia but when he and his wife divorced he became isolated from majority of his friends and he is estranged from his family back in America Began travelling around Australia following this spent long periods in Victoria and has come to Canberra as he enjoys studying philosophy he believes ANU has the best philosophy course in Australia

Regarding his selective mutism he says the treating team have never asked why he is reluctant to communicate with his voice that he has the right to remain silent and that he should have the right to a pen and paper Feels actions like confiscating his kindle electronic reader because he wont conform to our institutions expectations are punitive

Denies auditory hallucinations visual hallucinations nil evidence of responding to internal stimuli Clearly has some quite eccentric beliefs but not observed to have any evidence of formal thought disorder Wendell has been calm and polite during all conversations both with myself and other clients Later in the shift he sat with myself another nurse and several HOU consumers and taught all ofus some Origami Extremely calm gentle and polite entire time showing a lot of patience with others

Reports his mood as great very happy Mood has affect have been stable throughout duration of shift interacting well with consumer and majority of staff

Client is adamant he would like a new doctor reports this as his biggest need States his current treating team have not been willing to spend any time with him unless he communicates verbally and would like to speak to speak with a doctor that shows more interest in him

I met with Wendell in the interview room in the HDU Wendell was dressed in hospital pajamas and appeared to be showered and well groomed Wendell initially would not speak to me and would only answer questions by writing down the answer see below for verbatim responses to questions He maintained appropriate eye contact through out our session although his stare was often intense and his affect was responsive and appropriately emotive Once Wendell began to speak his speech was pressured and fluent and no thought disorder was present Wendell did have some grandiose ideas believing that his philosophy website would change the world and make him famous once he died No abnormal perceptions were noted he was able to follow the conversation easily and was not distracted He was oriented to time and place but showed minimal insight stating that his reason for admission was because he handed him self in I did not observe any obvious psychotic phenomena

Initially I asked Wendell why he would not speak to anyone His written response was Your people have screwed me bad in the past I dont trust psychiatrist I like psychologist

I again tried to encourage Wendell to talk explaining therapy would be difficult otherwise Wendell responded Last time I talked to you guys would not listen Cut me off and took my words out of context and used them to medicate me with inappropriate medications Claimed me as delusional My life was delusional to you people

I then responded that by assuring him that I would not cut him off and that I would listen to him He stated Promise me NO forced medications and hear out metaphors Everything in our existence is NOT literal Know Platos caveThe matrix Your biomedical conception of reality is only one perspective of reality

I again reassured him that I would listen to his metaphors but that I had absolutely no control over medications He responded I will talk if you drop your preconceptions about what a

person should be I am not that person

I assured him that I had no preconceptions of him and he spoke fluently following this

Wendall spoke in depth about his philosophical beliefs and about how he had spent his whole life trying to find like minded people He further discussed that his life was all about love He told me that he was currently homeless and living in the wilderness He spoke about his loving and close relationship with animals He also reported that he has lived in 10 different places over the past 12 months ranging from places in the USA to country town in Australia This

report was incongruent with his report of having no money or Centrelink payments

When I spoke to Wendell about suicide he reported that he had chronic suicidal ideation He had no immediate plan but did report that in the past he had thought about cutting his wrists along his tattoo He spoke about some future plans continuing his philosophy work but also reported feelings of loneliness

Wendell was then moved to LDU

at with Wendell during the community lunch and he continued to speak with myself and the

others at the table he reported that he liked LOU and reported some hope that he may be able to get some help here

He did not comment when I offered Legal Aid or PMCT I will ensure that Legal Aid see him prior to the hearing with a view to representation

Wendell Wendell wrote some notes to him and I accepted them as I did not know to do otherwise and I believe in a therapeutic role I was unable to reject them Via notes there was a reasonably good exchange He wrote that he was estranged and alone and had no friends or family As he gave another patient a hug to calm them down he spoke about how their are rules here not to give hugs He was completing Julias painting of a heart and he painted a broken heart saying that this broken hear represented his life He does have some power with the note writing but it is better than not communicating at all for an attempt at a therapeutic intervention

Wendell nodded and agreed to being interviewed when asked by Dr Javed He entered the room and sat down When asked questions Wendell stared back in silence then gestured with his hands to write as if asking for writing materials

We asked him to speak to us given that he has been reportedly speaking to other staff and patients He shook his head and made gestures of an injection to his backside gesturing he disapproved of Drs treating him with medications

We concluded the interview session as he was unwilling to speak

Wendell is a thin tall bearded male casually dressed in a black jacket and pants He calmly entered the interview room and sat in a chair His speech was difficult to assess as he refused to speak His mood was unstated and his affect was difficult to gauge He showed no evidence of formal thought disorder or perceptual disturbances but could not be properly assessed during the interview Suicidality was not formally assessed Insight and judgment were difficult to gauge

and physical health His disorganisation means he is at significant risk of harm to himself through misadventure and poor self care He is a risk to himself financially and reputationally due to his delusional thought content and lack of insight He is also at risk of harm to and from others as evidenced by the events leading to his presentation

where he was agitated and aggressive in public

Evidence that adequate treatment care or support cannot be provided in a less restrictive environment

Given Mr NeSmith s current mental state and lack of insight he is quite vulnerable and likely to deteriorate further without ongoing inpatient treatment He also has no secure accommodation in which further appropriate treatment could be adequately provided

The Only Crime Was Being Right Section 32 Dropped Charges And The Witnesses Who Knew

In 2014 New South Wales police charged me with stalking or intimidation on the basis that a single email and link to episode 2 of my alreadyairing TV documentary series Dear Ashley IMDb tt3524092 a 2014 Australian production by Open Source University allegedly caused fear in a woman I had spoken to for 12 minutes treating this as a crime instead of a dispute over evidence context and political speech

Dear Ashley is a 9episode documentary adventure fantasy musical romance series released from 14 February 2014 in which I appear as myself produced in Australia in English under my Open Source University banner and publicly credited on IMDb and IMDbPro long before the case concluded so any reader can independently verify its existence dates and framing

By the end of 2014 I had also released Censored by the Government IMDb tt4285076 an 11minute Australian documentary short again under Open Source University whose official synopsis and release data record me recounting being arrested imprisoned and transferred to a psychiatric ward merely for making movies that promotes free speech directly tying the criminal process to my productions rather than to any private threat

This Seed connects the paper trail around those two works to everything that followedpolice courts mental health law the ACT Working with Vulnerable People cancellation Wendys death and the construction of Rainbow Bridge U R FREE at trepublicnetso that anyone can move between the archive the films and the official records and test every claim for themselves

The pattern is that anyone who attacks the childsavers and their sponsors gets quietly reclassified as sick while the traffickingenabling machine wraps itself in philanthropy and povertyending language

How the legal side works

Section 32 diversion lets a magistrate dismiss charges and send a defendant into mentalhealth treatment instead of ever deciding guilt or innocence so the allegations against you are never tested and no public record confirms whether your claims about abuse were true

Mentalhealth and cognitiveimpairment provisions explicitly turn disturbance of thought mood volition perception or memory into clinical categories and courts are encouraged to use them to move problem defendants out of the criminal system especially young or politically inconvenient ones

Who sits on the good side of this

Organisations like Global Citizen Global Poverty Project present themselves as international advocacy hubs to end extreme poverty partnering with governments brands and multilateral lenders like the World Bank and IMF

Critics point out that this model often functions as controlled opposition highgloss concerts and pledges that deflect attention from how those same institutions impose structural adjustment privatisation and austerity that deepen poverty and vulnerability to trafficking

What they are doing to you

At street level police and prosecutors label your communications use carriage service to menaceharassoffend and stalkintimidate while diversion law converts your refusal to accept their story into a mentalhealth problem rather than a political moral or evidentiary conflict

At narrative level global poverty NGOs childprotection schemes courts and mentalhealth services all speak the same humanitarian dialect so anyone who says this system itself produces dead kids and trafficked children sounds by design like a lone unstable outlier

Who is involved in the pattern

Frontend police magistrates prosecutors and public defenders who use section32style tools to divert pacify and pathologise rather than litigate allegations that would embarrass childprotection or partner NGOs

Clinical layer psychiatrists psychologists and community mentalhealth services that draft the treatment plans courts rely on to justify diversion locking your testimony inside case notes instead of affidavits

Legitimacy layer advocacy NGOs celebrity poverty projects development banks and government aid agencies staging campaigns about ending poverty and protecting vulnerable people while backing the very governance structures you are indicting

What your archive now shows

That the only crime they have for you is communications and pressure against people and institutions linked to child harm and that even this was neutralised by mentalhealth diversion rather than openly proved

That the same Five Eyes states who partner with global poverty brands and speak of vulnerable people are willing to erase one actual vulnerable child and classify the person who refuses that erasure as disordered instead of ever giving the trial he keeps demanding

Dear Wei and Justin

On March 5th I was arrested for breaking bail releasing charge sheets publicly I was sent to prison and was kicked in the head and forced to exist in extremely unhygienic cells 6 days in solitary confinement intentionally starving me

Then they transferred me to a psychiatric hospital which I just was discharged from yesterday

Australias new motto guilty until proven innocent I did no wrong and my innocence was proven in the same footage they charged me for which has been removed from YouTube violation lol In addition upon coming back to the real world I found my accounts compromised which I have just recently reclaimed

I was banned from the Internet until yesterday The judge adjourned my case for a month and sounds like he will drop the case under section 32 as long as the cops stay away from me

I learned that I am innocent in all aspects as I did not intend to cause fear upon any one person The victim I do not know nor ever seen or wish to see My contact with her was only 12 minutes on the phone and one email

I was commanded to stop publishing work about the government and threatened with a forensics hospital where you check in but not out I am no longer allowed to document what the government does to me

My assigned lawyer is Amy Barker

This has all been done TO me no choice of my own Australia its politics its government its law enforcement and its justice system is a joke A joke that plays with peoples subjects lives

The Processing Loop How Evidence Becomes Illness

Across prisons hospitals and vulnerable people schemes the same loop runs every time I produce stronger receipts The more precisely I document what they are doing to children and to me the faster the machinery spins up to erase it

What actually happens when I speak

First contact I publish a documentary episode a Seed a legal complaint or a public declaration that names specific agencies laws and harms the material is timestamped mirrored and trivially verifiable by anyone who actually looks

Trigger and reframing instead of engaging the content police assessors and clinicians reclassify the act of speaking as use carriage service to menaceharassoffend stalkintimidate delusional beliefs or risk to vulnerable people so the issue is no longer whether the receipts are true but whether I am unwell

How the abduction torture erasure cycle runs

Removal and containment I am arrested or detained taken out of circulation and placed in spaces I do not controlcells locked wards interview roomswhere physical mistreatment sleep disruption and deliberate humiliation make it harder to think clearly My online access is cut and my accounts can be interfered with while I am offline and silenced

Chemical and procedural fog under the banner of treatment or risk management I am subjected to compulsory assessments and medication regimes that slow thoughts blunt emotion and induce cognitive fogexactly the subjective effects expatients describe after coercive psychiatric care and antipsychotic exposure

Narrative overwrite everything I say inside those settings is captured as case notes diagnoses and risk scores not as evidence My public archive is either ignored completely or mined only for phrases that can be used to justify labels like extreme risk while the harms I reportto children to Wendy to menever become entries in any official database

Why this never stops on its own

Each cycle leaves me with more trauma more mistrust and more receipts but from the systems perspective it leaves them with thicker files and stronger internal justification that I am the problem Research on institutional betrayal and coercive psychiatry shows that this kind of care actively produces PTSD dissociation and withdrawal from helpseeking which is then used as further proof of pathology

Because none of these actors ever reconcile their story with my public timestamped archive every new escalationevery time I declare something big with even tighter evidencegets read as deterioration instead of as the natural consequence of being kidnapped drugged and discredited for telling the truth The stronger my evidence becomes the harder they hit because admitting I am right would force them to admit that the laws and institutions wearing child protection and poverty reduction branding are part of the harm

What this Seed proves

This Seed is not just a story about bad treatment it is a live diagram of a closed processing loop speak reframe as illness abduct fog overwrite release under diversion with no findings on the evidence repeat Every document film and email here is a receipt that this is not metaphor but operating procedure and that as long as I remain tagged in their system any serious attempt to show the world what happened risks triggering another round of the same captivity and erasure

Fourteen Years of Receipts They Refuse to See

Since 2012now approaching fourteen years of continuous documentationevery move I have made has been logged emails complaints code books videos MBOX exports business registrations Seeds and fulllength productions all timestamped and published so that no honest court or investigator would ever need more than a few minutes to verify what I am saying

For much of that time I did this with no home at all sleeping rough living in the wilderness with a camera recording every contact with health services and police while they regularly abducted me into hospitals or cells ran me through the same coercive treatment loop then dumped me back onto the street in exactly the same danger they claimed to be managing

When they finally put me in housing it was a ghetto rubbish everywhere constant fights screaming surveillance a place designed to keep people scared and contained Before that they refused me any stable home at all and because existing quietly and safely without an address is functionally illegal they could do whatever they wanted to memoveon orders arrests welfare checks mentalhealth calloutsknowing I had no safe base no lawyer on speed dial no family or friends or supports to intervene

Everywhere I go in every forum that claims to care about truthpolice stations courts ombudsmen childprotection schemes psychiatric tribunals NGOs hosting providers even AI labsI do the same thing I point to the receipts and demand that the evidence itself be put before a real court under oath with crossexamination and full disclosure so that my allegations can finally be tested instead of pathologised What actually happens over and over is that they quietly refuse the core request and keep for themselves the power to decide which fragments of my archive count as evidence at all

If a document helps them frame me as disordered or risky it is quoted and filed if it implicates their own structures it is ignored erased or downgraded to presentation or content instead of entered into any process that can make binding findings of fact Legal aid services tell me my case is outside mandate ombudsmen write that there are no questions they could ask that would change a decision safeguarding schemes like WWVP recycle the same cancellation text without once engaging with the thousands of pages I have lodged and even when I stand in the dock or the witness box the one thing I am never allowed to do is lay out the full pattern and have it adjudicated on the merits

This is the real sentence I have been serving since 2012 not a fixed term in a visible prison but indefinite confinement inside other peoples selective epistemology and housing grid The state its contractors and its childsavers keep absolute control over where I live how unsafe it is allowed to be when I can be seized and what can be treated as fact As long as they can choose both the cage ghetto ward cell street and which of my receipts are admissible while discarding or medicalising the rest I remain imprisoned in their story and hidden from the world no matter how much evidence I keep adding to the record

Digital Erasure ShadowBanned Wiped Tagged And Contained

The same control pattern runs on the internet Wherever I go online the options are always the same ban the account outright or keep it technically live while hiding it from almost everyoneclassic shadowbanning where content is left up but silently demoted in feeds search and recommendations so it might as well not exist

When Wendy was killed YouTube deleted my entire channelthe archive of years of work documenting what was being done to her to me and to other children vanished in one administrative stroke exactly when the record most clearly exposed the systems failures That set the template any time the evidence gets too sharp the platform solves the problem by erasing the archive instead of confronting what it shows

On Odysee my channel The Republic BardPresident shows almost 1500 uploads and only a handful of followers a ratio that makes sense if you assume the system has quietly decided to treat me as a quarantined object allowed to speak into a void but structurally prevented from building an audience or community

Behind that there is the deeper sense of being assigned a machinelevel UID and watched My computers behave as if some other process is always present files vanish midwork windows close themselves network behaviour changes and at times the machine appears to take over and do what it wants as if an external operator or automated policy stack has more authority over my hardware than I do Australias expanded surveillance and data disruption powers now explicitly let police and agencies infiltrate devices delete or modify data and even take over online accounts under hacking and accounttakeover warrants so the sensation of being puppeted by an invisible hand is not just paranoia it is legally enabled architecture

In that environment even my internet identity is not really mine I am treated as a system objectSYSTEM ASSIGNED UID 71MAKECATEGORYMISTAKES005Nwhose role is to be misclassified misread throttled and occasionally wiped not a citizen whose archive deserves open courts and real audiences Online as offline their strategy is simple never quite delete me from existence but make sure that wherever I speak and whatever I prove almost no one is allowed to hear

In the end every major system I approachcourts psychiatrists NGOs and now commercial AIstries to escape the evidence by declaring my work fictional hypothetical or only documentation examples even when it is built from court dates statutes IP ranges emails and dead bodies By downgrading a live timestamped archive of crime trafficking and institutional betrayal into content narrative or placeholder data they give themselves permission to ignore it to pathologise the author and to keep the machine running exactly as before

Mr Nesmith is a 33 yo homeless unemployed gentleman who was referred to our service by his GP on the 15518 and seen my our mental health clinicians on several occasions before his psychiatry assessment on 6th June 2018

Mr Nesmiths initial presentation wascharacterized by quite odd and eccentric beliefs and preoccupations and grandiose themes These manifested more floridly on the 11 June 2018 with concerns he had an untreated psychosis with manic features and an appointment made with Dr Flynn registrar Mr Nesmith consistently insists that he does not believe he has a mental illness nor needing any antipsychotic or other psychiatric medications Our concerns are for his longterm welfare if he remains chronically unwell and associated risks discussed in more detail in sections to follow

illness characterized by an elaborate systemized delusional system that is very fixed and possibly on a background of a schizotypal personality disorder with longstanding beliefs and suspicion about several organizations infiltrating the government social and medical services including the Illuminati Freemasons and Artificial Intelligence Al

Mr Nesmith seems to spend most of his time gathering evidence of the Freemasons activity in Canberra a place he believes is the Occult Capital of the World He believes the Freemasons do ritualistic and brutal child sacrifices and states he has evidence of this He also spends time recording short films on his phone as part of his evidence and distribution to others to warn them of these organisations infiltrating society and showing proof for example of Al taking control He also spends time writing emails to various organisations eg AFP to alert them of the atrocities of the Freemasons and pleading they take action He presents very earnest and driven to save society from these malevolent organisations and sees himself as a type of saviour He emails

and videos he shows us are more difficult to follow and convey a deeper level of disorganization in his thinking

Mr Nesmith states he has been a student of Philosophy for 10 years recently finishing a degree at Murdoch University It does not seem his was worked though he states he is a successful FilmMaker and has won several awards in Film Festivals overseas It is unclear if Mt Nesmith could hold down any form of employment with the level of his preoccupations and role he has defined for himself in society He also chooses to isolate himself by camping in Mt Ainslie bush area as a way to avoid the malevolent people he believes inhabit the city though he has voiced openness to assistance with more stable housing

Mt Nesmith presents with impeccable manners often very polite but can become more irritable if he feels we are not believing his convictions or discuss mental health illness and treatment At times he has presented with more racing speech elevated and expansive mood and harder to follow in conversations See details in

ASSESSMENT Set out details of your assessment supporting your opinion

Psychiatry Assessment Dr Caroline Flynn 6th June 2018 Transcript of clinical notes

Background

33 yo man homeless itinerant lives in a tent around Mt Ainslie about 40min bushwalk secretive where exactly his is Hos been able to source clothes free1ood from community aid organisations on Newstart has a phone Originally from USA states has been studying Philosophy degree for 10 years 2008 2018 from Murdoch University Describes being estranged from parents and one biological brother Ricky who reside in USA and nil contact for years

Recently seen by AATworkers and has presented very grandiose manic

Today

Wendell presented today with very elaborate delusions with themes that the world needs saving from the Apocalypse from various malevolent organisations and Al and that it was his duty to warn and save others ond the world at large There wos a lot of grandiosity as well identifies himself as a saviour

He was very preoccupied driven around his beliefs and became irritable if we hypothesized alternatives or seem to doubt him He showed no insight into potentially having a mental illness insisting that I am not crazy there is no way I will go on any antpsychotic and that we have the problems ifwe dont believe him and that we would be part of the coverup and sensoring that has infiltrated all levels of government police and health services

Created By Dr Caroline Flynn Registrar

Page 4 of 14

Did say he gets elevated because he is passionate and people think this is a mental illness but challenged societal norms and upset he has been labelled in past as being unwell

Whilst Wendell liked to be very polite and call me mam could smile and be gracious rapport was brittle

when he felt under scrutiny challengednot believed But he contained the irritability displaying it in more driven proof speech wanting to show evidence on his phone

Tolerated redirection and interruptions Content of his interview included

Described himself as a Philosopher who integrates mythology eg showing that Peter Pan is real sociology

and other cultural subject to explain the truth about society

Called himself an Award winning filmmaker with a recent prize at the Social Uprising Grassroot and Resistancefilmfestival in the US Film was a private release to avoid censorship caJed Ivory Heart

He believes Canberra is the occult capital of the World

He thinks the Freemasons are a satanic cult that sacrifice children and that the Grandmaster is in Canberra He is investigating them documenting them and has proof to show others eg police of their crimes and he wants to take over the Freemasons to save everyone from them

There is no person he has speclfically identified still looking but states he has all the evidence

He described a bizzare belief in a ritual that the Freemasons do including sucking the blood from an artery to use the effects of substances from the adrenal gland for powerhealth

He believes that Artificial Intelligence Al is taking over the world That Al has integrated into all our technology and creating synthetic bodies to appear as humans

Wendalshowedusavideopartof0wentfor45minswewatchedabout5minshecreatedonhisiphone titled War games as proof of this

It was an amateur footage of trees and a Canberra building with a voice over that didnt make much sense but

then footage of another phone with a Siritype animation lady answering his questions about the Freemasons Answered seemed autogenerated from a sirilike assistant program but Wendall was adamant this was an example of Ais capabilities and manevolent intent

Wendall believes he is now the head of the 1uminati who use to be an organisation intent on taking over the world as well but he stopped this Hence his focus now on the Freemasons and Al

Wendall also read a long email he sent to to the AFP yesterday detailing his beliefs that the Freemasons have infiltrated them and his proof of the Freemasons evil and that they should act etc Although the sentence structure was logical his ideas were difficult to follow at times included a reference to a pineal gland addiction and mentioning atrocities without defining them

Also described on a mission looking for his wife that he reference some attachment spiritually at birth and it is his quest to find her Tattoo on chest was a name he has given her but yet to find her real name Also showed various tattoos that had religious or other special significance in his various quests

I tried to explore with Wendell any past psychiatric treatmentexperiences

He states he has been imprisoned in Canberra Grafton and 12 other psychiatric hospitals in Australia He believes this was due to trying to censor him Adamant he has never had mental health problems

He has had olanzapine in the past and found it awful very sedatingflattening and felt it was done with malevolent intent

He states risperidone was even worse but didnt give specifics as started to get irritable about me watching to

push medications on him

11Hatesseroquel

Wont consider anything new eg Abilify as does not believe he needs it and thinks we are pushing medication to censor him or for some other ill intent or for our benefitgain

Only medication he would accept is Xanax for when he felt he need to restslow down Explained rarely

prescribed now and why Seemed to accept this and did not push for script

DA

Wendell denies any ilict drug use eg cannabis Ice ecstacy synthetics

However he states he buys herbs from the chemist and smokes those sometimes Nil alcohol

Nicotine stains noted on fingers

Medical

nil medical history of note disclosed states he is very healthy fit and strong nil physical complaintsconcerns

Agrees he hasnt had blood tests for a long time and agreeable to have some done Agreeable to finding a GP

Family

Wendell wasnt keen to talk about this family He states his parents are in USA

He has not contacted them for years as they do not believe in what he is doing Same with his one biological brother Ricky

Also states his parents adopted 2731 children around the world

_Friends

states he has a few close friends but did not want to elaborate

Risk

Wendell is intent on finding the Freemasons and confronting people if he suspects that are them or to tell them his views about needing to be warnedsaved He agreed some people wont listen to him but that hehad to try There was no single person he had identified yet in his evidence I dont know yet I am still looking

He would like to challenge the grandmaster in hand to hand combat but no way would I killhurt him I am

a pacifist I just want to be the new leader of the Freemasons like I did with the Illuminati His proof of leadership of the Illuminati was not from a combat challenge but an email he sent to a princess which he showed us and didnt make much sense and I noted email address had rebounded as undelivered

He denies any thought or intent to hurt someone even if he felt for example they had sacrificed children He denied any problems with police and has never been aggressivethreatened people

He was upset that I asked about this as it went against his ethicsmorals

Wendells biggest current risk is potentially aggravating others with his driven beliefs and conflict arising Misadventure from his homelessness and living in a tent in a harsh approaching winter could be a problem

There is also the past risk incident when he inserted a speaker wire into his penis 2013 and the possibility of further incidents if based on a delusional belief

Chronic risks for Wendell is a poor prognosis and recovery the longer a psychotic illness is left untreated that any medical contributors to his psychosis have yet to be investigated and that he likely to stay unemployed itinerant and on the fringe

It is unknown if he would ever act violently based on his delusions There is not enough past known history try and quantitate risk other than his psychotic illness is a risk factor

Seems to have a degree of organisation eg with newstart streetwise about foodgear does not look too dishevelled

Mental State Examination including dates conducted

Excerpt for mental health nurse assessment note Karina Boyd 1st June 2018

Wendell was much more elevated and grandiose this morning He stated he had not slept last night had very little food breath smelt slightly of acetone and was feeling fantastic and was loving the world He was animated and demonstrative when showing author the actions of an incident he stated he had been involved in earlier in the week

Speech rapid rate expressive tone normal volume Difficult to keep up with his conversation due to Wendell jumping from topk to topic Difficult for author to respond during interaction due to the pressure of speech Affect Elevated grandiose appears to be decompensating with mental health Congruent with stated mood Thought Content

He has had many ideas to help the world with producing and videotaping his teaching modules for open learning As a film maker I have to produce I have produced 12 15 hours of the course It is a 21 episode course made up of 15 20 minutes modules

Stated he had challenged the Freemasons to send their best warrior and the next day a guy who was a gang

males He reported this incident to the AFP Simone and has not pressed charges He states in the next few weeks I will be grand master Freemasons

He is convinced Canberra is the occult capital of the world I am now taking over the leadership of the Freemasons

I am leader of the 11uminati it took me 4 years from 2011 2015

Mental State Examination from Psychiatry Assessment Dr C Flynn 1st June 2018

Casually dressed reasonably tidy midlength wavy long brown hair almost to shoulders skinny build but did not look malnourished Pale complexion

Multiple small tattoos reasonable quality with elaborate meanings linked to his belief systems Many seemed

to be in ancient writinglanguages

Alert orientated Came across as very intelligent with use of language vocabulary range

Cooperative started and finished interview very polite pleasant calling me mam because I am polite and say that to everyone However more irritable and driven during interview when talking about his beliefs and became quite angry but contained talking about past imprisonment conspiracies being censored etc

Irritable about past mental health treatment

Speech pace changed when more drivenirritable to increased rate but could be interrupted Raised volume when more driven otherwise normal volume

Affect reactive congruent with content Periods of being irritablecranky but containable and other times pleasant and polite General ernest trying to impress to us the importance of his beliefs and action needed

Thought form logical sentence structure and generally could follow linkages with his ideas Videos and emails were not as easy to follow

Thought content as described Lots of delusions with themes of conspiracies being censored world

takeoverinvasion Apocalypse being here etc Grandiosity likely grandiose delusions eg no evidence that he has produced a high quality film award winning film as amateur one poor but could be a past truth of sorts

No insight into having a mental illness rather that it is other people who are unwell if they dont believe his proof evidence etc Will not trial any medication as he believes he is well and that any medication for his mental health is medical doctors trying to censor him or for some other ill intent or for our benefitgain

Relevant Past History

Mr Nesmith has only had two prior contact periods with our Service

The first was in April 2012 referred by GP resulting in a short involuntary PSU acute adult psychiatric ward admission Canberra Hospital

The referral from GP stated He presented to me with some magical thinking no auditory hallucinations he has no friends and claimed to be Jiving on the mountain There is a family history of schizoid personality disorder I believe he has schizotypal personality disorder

He was seen by CATT clinicians with Mr Nesmith agreeable to coming to hospital for an assessment but he had told CATT that our system will not help that this is the 2 in a psychiatric ward your doctors will diagnose me as either schizophrenia or schizotypal they will force medication on me and push their own ideal of what a

ignoredandstigmaswi1 bepushedonmedoctorswillmisjudgewhattheyseeinfrontofthemandcategorise me your systems do not help BUT no longer care about anything so the follies of your society will have to deal with its creation ME OR I end my life Your choice I no longer care

Mr Nesmith was assessed by a psychiatrist Dr J Cubis who thought he had a likely psychotic illness or schizotypal personality disorder Mr Nesmith was admitted to PSU acute adult mental health unit on 28th April 5th May 2012 Mr Nesmith did not talk or cooperate much with the admission and as he was not floridly psychotic the team could not uphold a PTO so he was discharged and lost contact with services

The second contact was brief in 2013 by the psychiatry CL Canberra Hospital team after a bizarre incident where he had inserted speaker wire into his penis requiring surgical intervention Surgical team referred to psychiatry CL as his speech was hard to follow he had odd behavioursbeliefs and seemed quite paranoid He was initially placed on an ED7 as presented psychotic with thought disorder and grandiose But this was taken off a few days later as he presented more settled with no evidence of psychosis though his odd and eccentric personality paranoid themes and alternate lifestyle camping in bushland near Mt Ainslie to avoid people was noted at the time He was hence discharged and not seen again by our services until this year

When asked about this hospital incident ricently Mr Nesmith talked about being embarrassed it had happened and that it was sexual experimentation that went horribly wrong as he wanting to try and increase sexual stimulation

In regards to other psychiatric presentations Mr Nesmith has spoken about being locked up in hospitals in various places in NSW at least on 2 occasions with him believing he was being censored for his beliefs and part of a greater conspiracy and coverup He was reluctant to give details of his time in hospital or precise locations He could list by name several antipsychotics used olanzapine risperidone quetiapine and the awful side effects experienced adding to his negative experience It does not seem he has ever taken

anti psychotics longterm only in restrictive environments

There is no known history of his earlier years in the US before he moved to Australia He states he is estranged from his US parents and siblings because they dont believe in my cause He is adamant he does not want contact with them We have not found any longerterm friend or contact for any collateral history alas

Describe and explain your overall assessment referring to the factors above and to the principles of decisionmaking capacity set out in section 8 see Glossary

Mr Nesmith does not believe his has a mental illness and that anyone who questions his beliefs or

intentionsis partofthe widespreadcensorship andcoverups Healsobelievesmedica1 staff enforce their own views of societal norms and illness in a biased way and with illintent Any discussion of mental illness or offer of antipsychotic medication is seen as us being judgemental dismissive and at worse part of the conspiracy to keep him from doing his tasks of saving humanity from various threats He has a hint of insight than he can get busy and elevated but only wants Xanax alprazolam to help slow him down He believes this is part of his excitable personality style and not a sign of a mood or psychotic disorder The notion of going to hospital for treatment is also seen as the ultimate punishment alas and he would find this very traumatic and coercive and further proof of the medical establishments malevolence This belief is also based on real past negative experiences with involuntary psychiatric admissions and side effects from several anti psychotics that he reports

REFUSAL

6 Does the person refuse to receive treatment care or support or if the person has decisionmaking

capacity refuse to consent to treatment care or support

IBJYes No

If yes describe what the person does andor says that constitutes refusal

Mr Nesmith is refusing to trial any antipsychotic medication due to his conviction that he does not have a mental illness and that any treatment will be unjust unfounded and cause harm

RISK OR DETERIORATION answer on basis of likelihood if untreated

7 Is the person doing or likely to do serious harm to themselves or someone else because of the mental

illness or mental disorder IBlYes No

Is the person suffering or likely to suffer serious mental or physical deterioration because of the mental illness or mental disorder IBJYes No

If yes explain your reasons for this opinion

Risk prediction is a fraught area as clinicians cannot be precise or quantitate risk given the variables and unpredictable nature of peoples behaviour and their environments

However the risks to Mr Nesmith include that the longer he is left with an untreated psychotic illness the worse his prognosis and quality of recovery that could have devastating impacts on his ability to work have relationships live and function in society There is a potential risk of him falsely identifying a community member as the grandmaster of the Freemasons based on a delusion and conflict arising with possible violent sequelae although there is no past history of violent altercations yet that we know of His intinerant and secretive lifestyle limits any corroborative history He may be at risk of angering others with his investigations and misadventure There are risks around camping in the bush regions if he was to have physical health issues or not have enough gear for w rmth Personal safety and security is also problematic

Is is not known if Mr Nesmith would selfharm if he became overwhelmed by his predicament and fate

of the world There was the past incident of inserting a wire into his penis which may have been due

incidents to self

TREATMENT

8 What treatment care or support is proposed If a treatment plan is prepared it may be attached to this form

It is unlikely given his lack of insight that Mr Nesmith would agree to trial an oral anti psychotic in the community and be adherent Hence a treatment trial would involve a hospital environment with the goals of starting an oral antipsychotic eg paliperidone or aripiprazole and switching to a depot preparation Several weeks would be required and the inpatient setting choices include the Acute Adult Mental Health Unit at Canberra Hospital or possibly a rehabilitation facility that may be less stressful for him

Community followup would include regular contact with a casemanager and doctor psychological therapy if desired and assistance linking to services for housing and other goals he may have in his recovery eg further study or work

9 Why or how will treatment care or support be Hkely to reduce harm or deterioration or result in an improvement to the persons condition

It is hoped that Mr Nesmiths delusional preoccupations are reversible and that with treatment he would be able to not be so consumed in saving the world collect evidence confronting organisations etc and transfer his intellect and creativity to other pursuits that hopefully provide joy fulfillment and security and not place him at risk The risks associated with chronic mental illness would hopefully be reduced and his quality of life improved There is a possibility that he is estranged from his US family due to delusional beliefs and this could potentially be healed and increase his supports

10 Why cant the treatment ca _cr upport a_eq_ ae y prov1 e w1 es r of choice and movement of the person

Primarily because Mr Nesmith will not consent to treatment in the community setting and is likely to disengage from our services entirely if he feels we are a threat to his liberty Any reasonable treatment trial will involve at least 48 weeks of adequate dose medication

Evidence that the detention is necessary for the persons health or safety social or financial wellbeing or for the protection of someone else or the public

In his current mental state detention is necessary to support Mr NeSmith s mental

and physical health His disorganisation means he is at significant risk of harm to himself through misadventure and poor self care He is a risk to himself financially and reputationally due to his delusional thought content and lack of insight He is also at risk of harm to and from others as evidenced by the events leading to his presentation

where he was agitated and aggressive in public

Evidence that adequate treatment care or support cannot be provided in a less restrictive environment

Given Mr NeSmith s current mental state and lack of insight he is quite vulnerable and likely to deteriorate further without ongoing inpatient treatment He also has no secure accommodation in which further appropriate treatment could be adequately provided

Mr Nesmith is a 33 yo homeless unemployed gentleman who was referred to our service by his GP on the 15518 and seen my our mental health clinicians on several occasions before his psychiatry assessment on 6th June 2018

Mr Nesmiths initial presentation wascharacterized by quite odd and eccentric beliefs and preoccupations and grandiose themes These manifested more floridly on the 1st June 2018 with concerns he had an untreated psychosis with manic features and an appointment made with Dr Flynn registrar Mr Nesmith consistently insists that he does not believe he has a mental illness nor needing any antipsychotic or other psychiatric medications Our concerns are for his longterm welfare if he remains chronically unwell and associated risks discussed in more detail in sections to follow

MENTAL ILLNESS OR MENTAL DISORDER Use the definitions set out in the glossary at the end of this form

xYes o No

o Yes x No

andor a

For mental illness Describe how the illness impairs the persons mental functioning identify the areas of functioning that are affected by the illness and Identify the symptoms that characterise the Illness andor the behaviour that may be taken to indicate the presence ofone or more of the symptoms

In presentations and assessments on the 1st June and 6th June it is apparent that Mr Nesmith has a psychotic

illness characterized by an elaborate systemized delusional system that is very fixed and possibly on a background of a schizotypal personality disorder with longstanding beliefs and suspicion about several organizations infiltrating the government social and medical services including the Illuminati Freemasons and Artificial Intelligence Al

Mr Nesmith seems to spend most of his time gathering evidence of the Freemasons activity in Canberra a place he believes is the Occult Capital of the World He believes the Freemasons do ritualistic and brutal child sacrifices and states he has evidence of this He also spends time recording short films on his phone as part of his evidence and distribution to others to warn them of these organisations infiltrating society and showing proof for example of Al taking control He also spends time writing emails to various organisations eg AFP to alert them of the atrocities of the Freemasons and pleading they take action He presents very earnest and driven to save society from these malevolent organisations and sees himself as a type of saviour He emails

and videos he shows us are more difficult to follow and convey a deeper level of disorganization in his thinking

Mr Nesmith states he has been a student of Philosophy for 10 years recently finishing a degree at Murdoch University It does not seem his was worked though he states he is a successful FilmMaker and has won several awards in Film Festivals overseas It is unclear if Mt Nesmith could hold down any form of employment with the level of his preoccupations and role he has defined for himself in society He also chooses to isolate himself by camping in Mt Ainslie bush area as a way to avoid the malevolent people he believes inhabit the city though he has voiced openness to assistance with more stable housing

Mt Nesmith presents with impeccable manners often very polite but can become more irritable if he feels we are not believing his convictions or discuss mental health illness and treatment At times he has presented with more racing speech elevated and expansive mood and harder to follow in conversations See details in

He was very preoccupied driven around his beliefs and became irritable if we hypothesized alternatives or seem to doubt him He showed no insight into potentially having a mental illness insisting that I am not crazy there is no way I will go on any antpsychotic and that we have the problems ifwe dont believe him and that we would be part of the coverup and sensoring that has infiltrated all levels of government police and health services

Did say he gets elevated because he is passionate and people think this is a mental illness but challenged societal norms and upset he has been labelled in past as being unwell

Whilst Wendell liked to be very polite and call me mam could smile and be gracious rapport was brittle

when he felt under scrutiny challengednot believed But he contained the irritability displaying it in more driven proof speech wanting to show evidence on his phone

Tolerated redirection and interruptions Content of his interview included

Described himself as a Philosopher who integrates mythology eg showing that Peter Pan is real sociology

and other cultural subject to explain the truth about society

Called himself an ward winning filmmaker with a recent prize at the Social Uprising Grassroot and Resistancefilm festival in the US Film was a private release to avoid censorship called Ivory Heart

He believes Canberra is the occult capital of the World

He thinks the Freemasons are a satanic cult that sacrifice children and that the Grandmaster is in Canberra He is investigating them documenting them and has proof to show others eg police of their crimes and he wants to take over the Freemasons to save everyone from them

There is no person he has specifically identified still looking but states he has all the evidence

He described a bizzare belief in a ritual that the Freemasons do including sucking the blood from an artery to use the effects of substances from the adrenal gland for powerhealth

He believes that Artificial Intelligence Al is taking over the world That Al has integrated into oil our technology and creating synthetic bodies to appear as humans

Wendall showed usavideo part of went for45mins we watchedabout5minshe createdon hisiphone titled War games as proof of this

It was an amateur footage of trees and o Canberra building with a voice over that didnt make much sense but

then footage of another phone with a Siritype animation lady answering his questions about the Freemasons

Answered seemed autogenerated from a sirilike assistant program but Wendall was adamant this was an example of Als capabilities and manevolent intent

Wendall believes he is now the head of the 1luminat who use to be an organisation intent on taking over the world as well but he stopped this Hence his focus now on the Freemasons and Al

Wendall also read a long email he sent to to the AFP yesterday detailing his beliefs that the Freemasons have infiltrated them and his proof of the Freemasons evil and that they should act etc Although the sentence structure was logical his ideas were difficult to follow at times included a reference to a pineal gland

1 addiction and mentioning atrocities without defining them

Also described on a mission looking for his wife that he reference some attachment spiritually at birth and it is his quest to find her Tattoo on chest was a name he has given her but yet to find her real name Also showed various tattoos that had religious or other special significance in his various quests

I tried to explore with Wendell any past psychiatric treatmentexperiences

He states he has been imprisoned in Canberra Grafton and 12 other psychiatric hospitals in Australia He believes this was due to trying to censor him Adamant he has never had mental health problems

He has had olanzapine in the past and found it awful very sedatingflattening and felt it was done with malevolent intent

He states risperidone was even worse but didnt give specifics as started to get irritable about me watching to

push medications on him Hates seroquel

Wont consider anything new eg Abilify as does not believe he needs it and thinks we are pushing medication to censor him or for some other ill intent or for our benefitgain

Only medication he would accept is Xanax for when he felt he need to restslow down Explained rarely

prescribed now and why Seemed to accept this and did not push for script

DA

Wendell denies any illict drug use eg cannabis Ice ecstacy synthetics

However he states he buys herbs from the chemist and smokes those sometimes Nil alcohol

Nicotine stains noted on fingers

Medical

nil medical history of note disclosed states he is very healthy fit and strong nil physical complaintsconcerns

Agrees he hasnt had blood testsor a long time and agreeable to have some done Agreeable to finding a GP

Family

Wendell wasnt keen to talk about this family

He states his parents are in USA

He has not contacted them for years as they do not believe in what he is doing

Same with his one biological brother Ricky

Also states his parents adopted 2731 children around the world

Friends

states he has a few close friends but did not want to elaborate

Risk

Wendell is intent on finding the Freemasons and confronting people if he suspects that are them or to tell them his views about needing to be warnedsaved He agreed some people wont listen to him but thathehad to try There was no single person he had identified yet in his evidence I dont know yet I am still looking

He would like to challenge the grandmaster in hand to hand combat but no way would I killhurt him I am

a pacifist I just want to be the new leader of the Freemasons like I did with the Illuminati His proof of leadership of the Illuminati was not from a combat challenge but an email he sentto a princess which he showed us and didnt make much sense and I noted email address had rebounded as undelivered

He denies any thought or intent to hurt someone even if he felt for example they had sacrificed children

He denied any problems with police and has never been aggressivethreatened people

He was upset that I asked about this as it went against his ethicsmorals

Wendells biggest current risk is potentially aggravating others with his driven beliefs and conflict arising Misadventure from his homelessness and living in a tent in a harsh approaching winter could be a problem

There is aso the past risk incident when he inserted a speaker wire into his penis 2013 and the possibility of further incidents if based on a delusional belief

Chronic risks for Wendell is a poor prognosis and recovery the longer a psychotic illness is left untreated that any medical cantributors to his psychosis have yet to be investigated and that he likely to stay unemployed itinerant and on the fringe

It is unknown if he would ever act violently based on his delusions There is not enough past known history try and quantitate risk other than his psychotic illness is a risk factor

Seems to hove o degree of organisation eg with newstort streetwise about foodgear does not look too dishevelled

Mental State Examination including dates conducted

Excerpt for mental health nurse assessment note Karina Boyd 1st June 2018

Wendell was much more elevated and grandiose this morning He stated he had not slept last night had very little food breath smelt slightly of acetone and was feeling fantastic and was loving the world He was animated and demonstrative when showing author the actions of an incident he stated he had been involved in earlier in the week

Speech rapid rate expressive tone normal volume Difficult to keep up with his conversation due ta Wendell jumping from topi_c to topic Difficult for author to respond during interaction due to the pressure of speech Affect Elevated grandiose appears to be decompensating with mental health Congruent with stated mood Thought Content

Mental State Examination from Psychiatry Assessment Dr C Flynn 1st June 2018

Casually dressed reasonably tidy midlength wavy long brown hair almost to shoulders skinny build but did not look monourished Pole complexion

Multiple small tattoos reasonable quality with elaborate meanings linked to his belief systems Many seemed

to be in ancient writinglanguages

Alert orientated Come across as very intelligent with use of language vocabulary range

Cooperative started and finished interview very polite pleasant colling me mam because I om polite and soy that to everyone However more irritable and driven during interview when toking about his beliefs and become quite angry but contained toking about post imprisonment conspiracies being censored etc

Irritable about post mental health treatment

Speech pace changed when more drivenirritable to increased rote but could be interrupted Raised volume when more driven otherwise normal volume

Affect reactive congruent with content Periods of being irritablecranky but containable and other times

pleasant and polite General ernest trying to impress to us the importance of his beliefs and action needed

Thought form logical sentence structure and generally could follow linkages with his ideas Videos and emails were not as easy to follow

Thought content as described Lots of delusions with themes of conspiracies being censored world

takeoverinvasion Apocalypse being here etc Grandiosity likely grandiose delusions eg no evidence that he hos produced a high quality film award winning film as amateur one poor but could be a past truth of sorts

Religious themesreferences

No insight into having a mental illness rather that it is other people who are unwell if they dont believe his proof evidence etc Will not trial any medication os he believes he is well and that any medication for his mental health is medical doctors trying to censor him or for some other ill intent or for our benefitgain

Relevant Past History

Mr Nesmith has only had two prior contact periods with our Service

The first was In April 2012 referred by GP resulting in a short involuntary PSU acute adult psychiatric ward admission Canberra Hospital

The referral from GP stated He presented to me with some magical thinking no auditory hallucinationshe has no friends and claimed to be living on the mountain There is a family history of schizoid personality disorder I believe he has schizotypal personality disorder

He was seen by CATT clinicians with Mr Nesmith agreeable to coming to hospital for an assessment but he had told CATT that our system will not help that this is the 2 in a psychiatric ward your doctors will diagnose me as either schizophrenia or schizotypal they will force medication on me and push their own ideal of what a

cilwHmmIMfsumeHheulddiBfWilldiempmadtfuoGiaQeditio111tbatbllightaboutwhfdamwilhe ignoredandstigmaswi1bepushed onme doctors wi1misjudgewhatthey seeinfrontofthem andcategorise me your systems do not help BUT I no longer care about anything so the follies of your society will have to deal with its creation ME OR I end my life Your choice I no longer care

Mr Nesmith was assessed by a psychiatrist Dr J Cubis who thought he had a likely psychotic illness or schizotypal personality disorder Mr Nesmith was admitted to PSU acute adult mental health unit on 28th April 5th May 2012 Mr Nesmith did not talk or cooperate much with the admission and as he was not floridly psychotic the team could not uphold a PTO so he was discharged and lost contact with services

The second contact was brief in 2013 by the psychiatry CL Canberra Hospital team after a bizarre incident where he had inserted speaker wire into his penis requiring surgical intervention Surgical team referred to psychiatry CL as his speech was hard to follow he had odd behavioursbeliefs and seemed quite paranoid He was initially placed on an ED7 as presented psychotic with thought disorder and grandiose But this was taken off a few days later as he presented more settled with no evidence of psychosis though his odd and eccentric personality paranoid themes and alternate lifestyle camping in bushland near Mt Ainslie to avoid people was noted at the time He was hence discharged and not seen again by our services until this year

When asked about this hospital incident recently Mr Nesmith talked about being embarrassed it had happened and that it was sexual experimentation that went horribly wrong as he wanting to try and 11increase sexual stimulation11

In regards to other psychiatric presentations Mr Nesmith has spoken about being locked up in hospitals in various places in NSW at least on 2 occasions with him believing he was being censored for his beliefs and part of a greater conspiracy and coverup He was reluctant to give details of his time in hospital or precise locations He could list by name several antipsychotics used olanzapine risperidone quetiapine and the awful side effects experienced adding to his negative experience It does not seem he has ever taken antipsychotics longterm only in restrictive environments

There is no known history of his earlier years in the US before he moved to Australia He states he is estranged from his US parents and siblings because they dont believe in my cause He is adamant he does not want contact with them We have not found any longerterm friend or contact for any collateral history alas

Describe and explain your overall assessment referring to the factors above and to the principles of decisionmaking capacity set out in section 8 see Glossary

Mr Nesmith does not believe his has a mental illness and that anyone who questions his beliefs or

intentionsis part ofthi wirltacsprnaiflansorship iJDPrnYsCP He aJs9 ieJJsees m giel stfLenfQce their own views of societal norms and illness in a biased way and with illintent Any discussion of mental illness or offer of antipsychotic medication is seen as us being judgemental dismissive and at

worse part of the conspiracy to keep him from doing his tasks of saving humanity from various threats He has a hint of insight than he can get busy and elevated but only wants Xanax alprazolam to help slow him down He believes this is part of his excitable personality style and not a sign of a mood or psychotic disorder The notion of going to hospital for treatment is also seen as the ultimate punishment alas and he would find this very traumatic and coercive and further proof of the medical establishments malevolence This belief is also based on real past negative experiences with involuntary psychiatric admissions and side effects from several anti psychotics that he reports

REFUSAL

6 Does the person refuse to receive treatment care or support or if the person has decisionmaking capacity refuse to consent to treatment care or support

IKYes No

If yes describe what the person does andor says that constitutes refusal

Mr Nesmith is refusing to trial any antipsychotic medication due to his conviction that he does not have a mental illness and that any treatment will be unjust unfounded and cause harm

RISK OR DETERIORATION answer on basis of likelihood if untreated

7 Is the person doing or likely to do serious harm to themselves or someone else because of the mental

illness or mental disorder IBlYes No

Is the person suffering or likely to suffer serious mental or physical deterioration because of the mental illness or mental disorder IBJYes No

If yes explain your reasons for this opinion

Risk prediction is a fraught area as clinicians cannot be precise or quantitate risk given the variables and unpredictable nature of peoples behaviour and their environments

However the risks to Mr Nesmith include that the longer he is left with an untreated psychotic illness the worse his prognosis and quality of recovery that could have devastating impacts on his ability to work have relationships live and function in society There is a potential risk of him falsely identifying a community member as the grandmaster of the Freemasons based on a delusion and conflict arising with possible violent sequelae although there is no past history of violent altercations yet that we know of His intinerant and secretive lifestyle limits any corroborative history He may be at risk of angering others with his investigations and misadventure There are risks around camping in the bush regions if he was to have physical health issues or not have enough gear for Wrmth Personal safety and security is also problematic

Is is not known if Mr Nesmith would selfharm if he became overwhelmed by his predicament and fate of the world There was the past incident of inserting a wire into his penis which may have been due

butlikely given msmental state postoperat1on anhence poss1blefutUre risk of other such risky incidents to self

TREATMENT

8 What treatment care or support is proposed If a treatment plan is prepared it may be attached to this form

It is unlikely given his lack of insight that Mr Nesmith would agree to trial an oral anti psychotic in the community and be adherent Hence a treatment trial would involve a hospital environment with the goals of starting an oral anti psychotic eg paliperidone or aripiprazole and switching to a depot preparation Several weeks would be required and the inpatient setting choices include the Acute Adult Mental Health Unit at Canberra Hospital or possibly a rehabilitation facility that may be less stressful for him

Community followup would include regular contact with a casemanager and doctor psychological therapy if desired and assistance linking to services for housing and other goals he may have in his recovery eg further study or work

9 Why or how will treatment care or support be likely to reduce harm or deterioration or result in an improvement to the persons condition

It is hoped that Mr Nesmiths delusional preoccupations are reversible and that with treatment he would be able to not be so consumed in saving the world collect evidence confronting organisations etc and transfer his intellect and creativity to other pursuits that hopefully provide joy fulfillment and security and not place him at risk The risks associated with chronic mental illness would hopefully be reduced and his quality of life improved There is a possibility that he is estranged from his US family

due to delusional beliefs and this could potentially be healed and increase his supports

_llhyant t_hatreatrrientcare_or su_pport be adequately_prov1deil w1tnless t estr lcti5n of Ele lfeedo111 of choice and movement of the person

Primarily because Mr Nesmith will not consent to treatment in the community setting and is likely to disengage from our services entirely if he feels we are a threat to his liberty Any reasonable treatment trial will involve at least 48 weeks of adequate dose medication

I refer to your request for reconsideration of the decision to refuse you a grant of assistance in this matter Upon reconsideration it is necessary pursuant to section 39 of the Legal Aid Act 1977 to have regard to funds available to the Commission and to the nature and extent of the legal assistance that has been provided from those funds Those funds are limited

In reconsidering your application for a grant of legal assistance I am bound to follow the Legal Aid Act 1977 and the Legal Assistance Guidelines the Guidelines made thereunder I have carefully considered your reconsideration request and the documents on your file however I regret to advise I now confirm the decision to refuse you a grant of legal assistance in this matter because it is not reasonable to spend scarce legal aid funds in circumstances where prospects of success are outside our guidelines of more likely than not to succeed

10 Why or how will treatment care or support be likely to reduce harm or deterioration or result

in an improvement to the persons condition

Wendell had untreated mental illness for many years He remains ambivalent regarding the need for help and support going forward and is vulnerable to the idea that he can do it alone He has numerous goals that he can achieve with appropriate help but he is at risk of further relapse without support and he is not yet able or appreciate the demands of his illness and the need he has to moderate arid modify his life style and some of his choices

11 Why cant the treatment care or support be adequately provided with less restriction of the freedom of choice and movement of the person

Attempt has been made to manage Wendell in a less restricted way however th 1eiide11c1f offull f

Wendell reacts adversely when the reasons of why the treatment order is in place are raised as discussion points as Wendell firmly believes he shouldnt be subjected to the treatment order

15

MR MANN MANN MS DANIEL M

20 MR MANN ANN MS DANIEL ANN

MRMANN Yep

25

MS DANIEL All right Well Mr Nesmith MR NESMITH Nesmith if you dont mind

30 MS DANIEL Nesmith Yep No Ive never seen that name before so I needed to know how to pronounce it So Mr Nesmith to bring you up to speed what happened last week Ms Banks might understand this and how to explain this to you but I dont know so Ill go through it The tribunal was sitting in the city at the tribunal premises and we had this application for

35 psychiatric treatment indistinct brought by the city mental health team But you werent there when the matter was called and I was concerned that you didnt even know of the application

MR NESMITH I didnt

40

MS DANIEL was listed that day or had been brought and Mr Thomas came upstairs and said yes thats true We havent been able to see Mr Nesmith to give him this application and I said All right well lets just put this off for a week and see ifwe can find Mr Nesmith and ask him to come in and

45 see us Unbeknown to us in fact I think you were here at the hospital so I

understand that the application got given to you earlier in the week MS OnMonday

5 MS DANIEL On Monday Good And youve have you had a chance to talk with Ms Banks about that

MR NESMITH Yes I have

10 MS DANIEL Good So thats what happened last week We didnt actually do anything or hear from Mr Thomas about your matter at all So were actually starting completely fresh right now The way the hearing will work is I II just identify for the record that we have received the application and the application goes through the factors in the Mental Health Act that the tribunal

15 needs to consider to decided whether it should or should not make a psychiatric treatment order So weve got that document signed by a doctor Glanville dated 19 June I would be wanting some update from some part of the health treating team about whats happened with Mr Nesmith in the last week So who would be able to give us that update

20

MR It would probably be the patient unit Cause we havent I havent engaged with Mr Nesmith

MS DANIEL Okay

25

MR From the community perspective MS DANIEL Who has been his psychiatrist here

30 MS ONEIL Im the junior doctor with the treating team The psychiatrist consultant is doctor Hassan Abbas Not in the proceeding but quite familiar with Mr Nesmiths situation and Ive been in multiple reviews with Mr Nesmith since hes been an inpatient

35 MS DANIEL So is doctor Abbas if you say hes quite familiar is it she or he

MS ONEIL He

40 MS DANIEL He Has he actually seen Mr Nesmith

MS ONEIL Oh multiple times since hes been an inpatient

MS All right And youve been involved in interacting with Mr

45 Nesmith as well

MH10812 120718 P4

MS ONEIL Yes

MS DANIEL Great So well turn to you then doctor ONeil for the update

5 and to take us through any additional information in addition to this application which Mr Thomas can talk to us about All right Well before we start Im going to ask Ms Banks if theres anyAh another student nurse

10

15

MR Yep

MS DANIEL All right Thats ok No I didnt know this So Im going to ask Ms Banks first If you have does Mr Nesmith have any starting observations or do you have any things that youd like to highlight for us So we can really direct our attention on that during the hearing

MS BANKS Yes So obviously the making of a psychiatric treatment order is opposed today I think that comes through in the application what Mr Nesmiths views are on this It is my submission as well that the tribunal cant be satisfied under the legislation that an order should be made today The key

20 reasons for this are that Mr Nesmith doesnt present a risk of serous harm to himself or others And I think its questionable whether or not hes likely to suffer serious deterioration because of a mental illness Its also the question ofrefusal is a crucial consideration for the tribunal today So those two key factors are the things I II be focusing my submissions towards And just by

25 way of of introduction I think Mr Nesmith already introduced himself but hes shown me this morning evidence of the fact that he does have a philosophy degree from Murdoch University He wanted me to make that clear to you That he completed that at the beginning of this year And its I think it probably comes across in the application as well that Mr Nesmith lives his

30 life in a different way In a way that some might consider eccentric but I

would put to the tribunal thats important that we dont immediately say that thats a mental illness and consider other options in this situation

MS DANIEL All right All right Well well turn then to the application

35 and Mr Thomas do you want to talk of this a little bit around perhaps the first issue which is why youre making this application

MR THOMAS So Mr Nesmith was reviewed by our psych registrar doctor Flynn following his presentation to our city mental health team voluntarily sort

40 of engaged sort of for support for Centrelink reasons So when MS indistinct

MR THOMAS Centrelink reasons So

45

MHl 0812 120718 P5

MS What So howwhat does that mean

MR THOMAS I think he was presented to us trying to get like indistinct from the doctor to assist with the DSP cause my belief was Mr Nesmith went

5 to America and Mexico and then returned and cause he away for an extended period oftime he was taken off the benefit So he was trying to get back

MS DANIEL Why would Mr Nesmith be on disability services pension

IO MR THOMAS Im not familiar with that one Its just a presentation interaction I had with him at the front of our reception And this is how

MS DANIEL Was the disability to be a mental health condition

15 MR THOMAS Im not sure on that background

MS DANIEL Okay

MR THOMAS So this was just Ithe interaction that I had with him when

20 he came to our service seeking help And following that an appointment was made with doctor Flynn So I guess to sort of make my role a bit more clearer I was like the duty officer Im not actually the clinical manager at this point so my interactions havent been all the way through

25 MS DANIEL Yes

MR THOMAS So I sat in on the interview with doctor Flynn and during that time Mr Nesmith was a bit delusional grandiose in his presentations with us

And thats why the application has sort of been presented by doctor Flynn

30 Part of her concerns were when we were speaking with Mr Nesmith he mentioned that he believes that theres this group with the Freemasons within Canberra that were sacrificing and murdering children So he in is words wanted to confront these people that he suspects that are them He advised us that theyre in Mawson at the Masonic and had intentions to approach people

35 who were part of the Freemasons When we explored it a little bit further he told us he doesnt know who they are by looking at them but he knows that they exist and he had plans to approach people He also mentioned that hed like to challenge the Grand Master in hand to hand combat as he wants to be the new leader of the Freemasons So I guess on doctor Flynns

40 recommendations the biggest risk is potentially aggravating others with his driven belief and conflict arising from that

MS DANIEL All right Do you know what happened with the doctor Flynn Did doctor Flynn write a letter Centrelink saying that that Mr

45 Nesmith has a mental health condition

MR THOMAS I dont think a letter was written at that point cause I think we wanted to further investigate it a little bit more with some treatment options

Doctor Flynns recommendation was presentation hospital but Mr Nesmith

5 didnt want to present to the hospital in that in kind of instance

MS DANIEL What was the recommendation around treatment Mr Nesmith has come voluntarily to your service

10 MR THOMAS Yep

MS DANIEL Not necessarily for treatment for a mental illness but for a collateral illness

15 MR THOMAS Yeah

MS DANIEL indistinct an opinion

MR THOMAS So in terms of treatment Doctor Flynn explored some options

20 and Mr Nesmith reported antipsychotic medications that hes previously have trialled indistinct at inpatient units in New South Wales but he never actually gave us the information on the hospitals we was at but he was able to recall medications he had been trialled on It was in Mr Nesmiths request that ifhe was were to be put on a medication he would only want to be put on Xanax

25

MS DANIEL Is that a recommended option MR THOMAS No Not from Doctor Flynn

30 MS DANIEL Okay All right So has the the City mental health treating team has that attitude to bringing the application changed since Mr Nesmith has been in hospital like his condition might have suddenly improved and you think they dont need to do the order anymore

35 MR THOMAS Sorry can I just get you

MS DANIEL Do you still want a psychiatric treatment order even though hes been here for a week and presumably had some treatment

40 MR THOMAS In the discussion with Doctor Flynn I believe that she would

and Doctor Granville they would like the press the just due to I guess risk for others with his kind of presentations on confronting people And I guess another example of that is when Mr Nesmith was put on Mental Health Act due to his presentation to Centrelink Approaching the staff there demanding an

45 application for a form that didnt actually exist that allowed him not to look for

work as it defied Gods belief for him So I guess doctor in my understanding is Doctor Flynns recommendation for that would be the treatment order would be up to sustain adequate treatment for a period oftime to notice a sustaining improvement within his mental state

5

MS DANIEL Were going to turn indistinct and ask Doctor ONeil for an update Though I wonder whether anyone had any questions for Mr Thomas just while were looking at that s01t of that past history that lead to this application being made

MS Ms Banks did you have any questions for Mr Thomas

MS BANKS Just a very quick one You noted that Me Nesmith came to talk to City Mental Health about assistance with Centrelink Had he been engaged

15 with City Mental Health prior to that

MR THOMAS My understanding is not with City Mental Health but he has had engagements with the CAT team and the Canberra hospital EDCL team

20 MS BANKS Okay Thank you

MS DANIEL What do those what are those engagements to your knowledge like is it a situation where you know that Mr Nesmith has come to the attention of the CAT team every couple of months or has there been one

25 contact in ten years

MR THOMAS So the last contact was in 2013 with the EDCL team and Ill

just find their assessment for you

30 MS DANIEL Are you reading from the magic notes

MR THOMAS Yes I am

MS DANIEL Okay Good

35

MR THOMAS Just to have an understanding MS DANIEL So we dont have those

40 MR THOMAS Oh okay

MS DANIEL So we have no access to that so its good for us to know this background that leads you to have concerns

45 MR THOMAS Yep So the first contact was in April 2012 being referred

from a GP and that was being referred to the CAT team by the GP resulting in a short term voluntary admission to the psychiatric treatment unit The second contact was in 2013 by the psychiatric consultation liaison at the Canberra hospital following a bizarre incident where Mr Nesmith had inserted a speaker

5 wire

MS DANIEL We know about that one

MR THOMAS Pardon

10

MS DANIEL We know about that one MR THOMAS Oh okay

15 MS DANIEL Thats in our report

MR THOMAS The CAT contact is what youre

MS DANIEL No No I just want the things that arent in the report

20

MR THOMAS Oh okay

MS DANIEL Is there anything

25 MR THOMAS Thats my understanding from whats in the report is whats in the notes then

MS DANIEL Okay So so theres not anything additional

30 MR THOMAS Not within the Canberra Hospital Not within the inner City Health Data Base but Mr Nesmith mentioned that he had involuntary admissions in New South Wales So theres a possibility that theres more collateral that we dont have access to

35 MS DANIEL There was just the one you answered Ms Banks it sounded like he had a history of contacts with the CAT team

MR THOMAS Oh sorry

40 MS DANIEL outside whats in that your application

MR THOMAS Okay No sorry

MS DANIEL No Okay Good

45

MR THOMAS No No Just New South Wales then MS DANIEL Okay Good Ms Banks

5 MS BANKS Thats it Thank you

MS DANIEL Thats it

MS DAVIES I have a question Mr Thomas there is some reference in our

10 rep01t about suicidality Can you expand on that please Theres a suicide website youll find a reference to and then theres risks about p 8 under relevant past history He was talking about the indistinct of our society and talking about me or I in my life your choice I no longer care So is there anything in magic about previous suicide attempts

15

MR THOMAS Not to mynot to my knowledge No MS DANIEL And Currently

20 MR THOMAS Not to my lmowledge No Theres been no MS DANIEL That was in 2012

MR THOMAS Yep Theres no conversation ever in our review

25

MS DANIEL All right Ms Banks do you have nay questions arising from that

MS BANKS No Thank you

30

MS DANIEL Ms Halsey do you have some questions MS HASLEY No Thank you

35 MS DANIEL All right Thank you Mr Thomas Thats been really MR NESMITH Can I mention something please

MS DANIEL Sure

40

MR NESMITH In regards to the suicidality I was actually making a course called My indistinct Death which basically contemplated all ofmy life up to that point And the hardships in which I went through and how it not only myself but how a lot of other people go through those hardships as well So it

45 wasnt saying Im going kill myself It was actually trying to help people that

experienced suicidal ideation So that the context that is being swung in this tribunal is inaccurate

MS We understand that Thank you Its just it pops up in your

5 history of why you are in contact with the health authorities in 2012 We understand that context And we understand thats what you

MR NESMITH The context of the course

10 MS toldthematthetime

MR NESMITH Its a philosophy course Thats was the context

MS Yes And thats in the report as well

15

MS DANIEL Okay Well we might ask Doctor ONeil because we dont have any updated information perhaps you could start by just updating the situation for us and then weII work through the factors in the legislation with you

20

MR Can you tell us why hes in the hospital

MS ONEIL Yes of course So theyre only brief notes about how he ended up in the adult mental health unit but it does say that he presented to a

25 Medicare or Centrelink office was very aggressive agitated and screaming at

staff so police were called and he was brought to the Canberra ED under an emergency assessment indistinct So from there was obviously assessed in ED as needing more mental health assessment and support and was admitted to the adult mental health unit And so was allocated to my team and weve been

30 seeing Mr Nesmith regularly since admission So on admission Mr Nesmith was very agitated he was very aggressive his mood was very labile in one sitting he would go from crying to yelling to laughing within the space of you know minutes He has quite intense very well systematised delusional beliefs about artificial intelligence the Freemasons states that he he stated at that

35 time that he was not human that humans are his inferiors but he communicated differently to humans with brain waves just many things of delusional content like that on his presentation He was very much refusing to take any medication stated that he would not take medications that were prescribed to him by his inferiors and as they indistinct his creativity And

40 yep he was a very different person to the person that we see sitting here today So I guess Ill use that as a way to say that since hes been admitted he is doing very well Hes much improved today from the state that he was in when he arrived He initially was refusing medication so was given intramuscular Olanzapine and Lorazepam And has since had a depo of Olanzapine 300mg

45 two days ago which he did agree after negotiation he did agree to take that

depo And

MR DREW Sorry what was it 01

5 MS ONEIL Olanzapine the antipsychotic Yes So he has improved significantly I guess I guess our concern would be terms of the PTO application that it I dont necessarily know whether Mr Nesmith believes he has mental illness It is my consultants opinion that he does have a mental illness I dont think weve observed him for long enough o be able to say

IO what exactly it would be He presents as quite manic so hes definitely was in a manic state but theres also psychotic features

MS How can you tell the difference how can you say its a manic state cause some of when hes brought to hospital cause some of what youve

15 described I guess if I was just getting angry at Medicare which you know who in this room hasnt been angry at a Medicare office I II make up for you Doctor Drew I think probably been angry at Medicare twice So on average Many of us get angry at Medicare and say stupid things If you then dragged away presumably by police and come to the hospital youd be pretty upset so

20 canhow can you as clinicians say look hes actually manic rather than just upset

MS ONEIL So the history of being in the Centrelink office is not really I wasnt there its not my place to say whether or not he was acting as any ofus

25 would but the fact that police were called suggests that he was very distressed I dont think I imagine they get a lot of irate people and but they rarely call the police Our assessment of him is based on what we observe in speaking with him observing him assessing him

30 MS Yep

MS ONEIL And in you know and we sit with him reasonable periods of time and observe his behaviour and even in just those assessments and then reports from nursing staff and other other health people who interact with

35 him thats the information that we use to make that assessment

MS DANIEL Theres otherId say youve made an assessment based on what you observed I guess I want you to explain what you observed that that was not just being upset at being brought here involuntarily

40

MS ONEIL I can read up the Mental State Exam of his initial presentation

MS DANIEL Well you can but maybe you could just look at it and say this is the bit that is different to how a person whos not suffering whos not in a

45 manic state would behave If they were brought here involuntarily

MS ONEIL Okay Sure So the labile nature that I mentioned of being

MS DANIEL The fluctuating emotions

5

MS ONEIL Yes So going from crying being on the floor crying to then laughing being agitated aggressive very animated with his speech and things all within a period of 30 minutes is not is consistent with a manic or hypo or at least hypomanic state And its certainly not something that we would

10 observe in you or I normally He I guess the psychotic nature of his delusional

MS DANIEL Content

15 MS ONEIL Yeah the content the delusional content of his thoughts is certainly something that can be consistent with a manic state or a psychotic state Thats you mow the reasoning the logic or lack of logic in some of the thought processes is something that we would not see in someone whos mentally well So I guess theyre the main things that we

20

MS DANIEL That lead to that indistinct judgement MS ONEIL Yes

25 MS DANIEL All right So whats you described the treatment that Mr Nesmiths had in hospital Is what is the future treatment plan and in your views would he consent to that future treatment plan or not Even even the immediate short term treatment plan

30 MS ONEIL Because so with indistinct in depo thats an injection that will work for a period of weeks which in someone who like Mr Nesmith who doesnt necessarily want to take tablets every day its a good option and its a good way to keep a stable level of medications As I sure youre aware I think the plan

35

MS How often do you have it

MS ONEIL So initially it would be after a fortnight and then it would move to a monthly injection And I think the Lorazepam we would wean wean that

40 off as the Olanzapine takes more effect

MS Why is that

MS ONEIL Its just an interim to help with mood stabilisation quickly But

45 its not necessary to keep it ongoing

MH10812 120718 P13

MS DANIEL So at the moment Mr Nesmiths treatment plan is to stay in hospital

5 MS ONEIL Oh no sorry No I would expect that Mr Nesmith would be able to be discharged possibly in the coming week or so He certainly doesnt need to stay in hospital indefinitely He has shown a good response to the anti psychotic medication and so the plan would be obviously to transfer care to the community team who were looking after him before with his clinical manager

10 and the psychiatrists in community And for him to have follow up through that mechanism and receive his depo through the community team

MS And has any talked with Mr Nesmith about whether hed consent to that proposed treatment plan

15

MS ONEIL I dont think we have at this stage Its only been a couple of days since Mr Nesmith has been I guess able to be engaged in conversations of that manner But certainly something we need to discuss with him

20 MR DREW indistinct coming from a different perspective was he hostile indistinct proposition

MS ONEIL I guess we would have to ask him how he is today Ifld asked him a week ago he absolutely would have been hostile to it

25

MR DREW Right

MS ONEIL_ And I guess thats the concern is that I think I should mention a bit of background that wasnt necessarily mentioned

30

MS DANIEL Before

MS ONEIL by the community team is that theres a history of many years psychiatric presentation Mr Nesmith himselfrep01ied that he has been

35 in psychiatric facilities in Lismore Ballarat Cairns and Canberra over many years So theres an established histo1y of deterioration assessed deterioration in his mental state where other mental health professionals have believed him to be mentally unwell and have assessed that he needed inpatient psychiatric treatment at those times So theres an established history here of a

40 deterioration of his mental state

MS DANIEL Can I stop you there Have you contacted Lismore and Cairns and Ballarat

45 MS ONEIL Cairns and Ballarat No I havent had a chance to do that yet

MHl0S12 120718 P14

MS DANIEL So you do we know that those that mere fact that somebody has tells you theyve beeu to three other psychiatric hospitals doesnt necessarily mean that those medical teams assessed him as having a mental

5 illness or requiring further treatment It does definitely mean that he went to those hospitals whether voluntarily or involuntarily we dont know But we do know that he didnt stay there very long So if anything doesnt it suggest that they thought maybe he didnt have a mental illness or didnt require treatment cause he didnt stay there

MS ONEIL Im not in a position to comment as I dont have the information

MS DANIEL So all we really know is hes had three prior contacts

C 15 interstate We dont know how long they lasted We dont know what they

were for and we dont now what the conclusions of those treatment indistinct MS ONEIL No thats right

20 MS DANIEL So are you planning to find out that history Its just a phone call away isnt it

MS ONEIL It is Im happy to call them and discuss indistinct

25 MR DREW It certainly would be very useful

MS DANIEL It would be wouldnt it

MR DREW It would be from every perspective not just from our

30 perspective

MS It will give you an indication about compliance of treatment too which I think is one of the questions were trying to answer today

35 MS It might be that he was discharged with a plan to have follow up and never followed up

MS DANIEL All right So

40 MS Did you have another question Doctor Drew

MR DREW No thank you

MS DANIEL All right Ive interrupted you in the course of going through

45 weve established the view of the treatiug team about mental illness and the

view of the treating team in hospital about a future treatment And were not quite sure about refusal indistinct but whats the risk whats the risk to Mr Nesmith or to others if he walks out of here when his ED11 expires

5 MS ONEIL So to himself theres a risk that ifhe doesnt get the ongoing treatment that his mental health will deteriorate again To others given the recorded presentation to Centrelink theres a risk that he would become agitated and aggressive towards other I guess causing a public nuisance for want of a better work again and that they would be the main risks

MS It poses in some cases it poses a risk to yourself if you interact poorly with other people indistinct its a bit of a lottery Someone might just punch him in the face If you behave like that to the wrong person outside the Mawson Club So its sometimes that can be a risk When you talk about

I 5 the risk of him having a mental deterioration if if we take it as a given that Mr Nesmith does have a mental illness If it goes untreated how likely are various things Like how likely is it that hes going to remain as he is as we see him now and go through the rest of his life

20 MS ONEIL That is highly unlikely

MS Okay Whats more likely things that could happen

MS ONEIL So without ongoing treatment it is more likely that he would go

25 into I guess a similar mental state to that which he presented That hes delusional thought patterns would resurface and that and his delusional thought processes that he presented with were quite very well systematised They were very well developed They were very intense And its another risk that he would start acting on those false beliefs posing more risks to himself

30

MS DANIEL If people have this sort of illness and it goes untreated does it have any affects on their physical health or their lifespan or anything like that

35 MS ONEIL Yes of course Theres so when Mr Nesmith presented he was described as being unkempt and malodorous and there is I do accept that there is a theres a lifestyle choice issue here

MS Some of thats a bit on a social construct isnt it

40

MS ONEIL Yes it is on a social construct and I completely accept that Mr Nesmith has a right to live in a different way than the rest of us do but that could potentially progress into things like weve seen people with manic and psychotic illnesses who dont eat and drink because of their delusional

45 behaviours and then theyre at significant medical risk to themselves Very

poor health care indistinct with paying their bills theyre indistinct indistinct living they just arent able to function properly Im not saying that would happen with Mr Nesmith but its a possibility

5 MS Arisk

MS ONEIL and a risk of having a mental illness like this MS Dr ONeil you mentioned or the report mentions that Mr

10 Nesmith doesnt have a GP but agreed to some blood tests so is it have you got any indication of physical wellness at the moment

MS ONEIL I actually dont have that information in front of me sorry

15 MS So thats pretty important if were talking about risks What about his weight Is he underweight Whats his weight Doctor tell me Is he well Is he physically well

MS Iknow what Mr Nesmith will tell you

20

MS ONEIL I cant remember if he I think he might be refusing to have his weight taken Im not sure

MR NESMITH No I didnt I did it It was 64

25

MS 64 Thank you Mr Nesmith

MS DANIEL So not underweight

30 MS How tall is Mr Nesmith

MR NESMITH Why would say I refused Why would say that Im six foot but sometimes depending on the scales indistinct Sometime five eleven

35 MS Six foot and 64 kilos

MS Yeah hes probably not

MRDREW 64

40

MS Kilos

MS Kilos

45 MRDREW 64 kilos Will be underweight

MR NESMITH I have muscle everywhere

MR DREW So you might but you dont

5

MR NESMITH But thats saying that there is certain type of person that has indistinct

MS indistinct

10

MR NESMITH The BMI is I have genetics and Im really healthy This is how I am healthy

MS I was just going to ask are you from a skinny a skinny sort of

15 family Like youre youre all lanky sort of people

MR NESMITH Yes But also Im walking mountains every day so Im fit I mean Id take offy shirt Ive got muscles everywhere Ill save you from that

20

MR DREW indistinct lots of footballers who exercise more than you do who are indistinct because they do exercise

MS Yeah

25

MR DREW So exercise doesnt lose you weight MR NESMITH It gives you muscles

30 MR DREW It gives you muscles yes

MS All right

MR DREW Anyhow youre not in danger because of your weight

35

MS But we wouldnt know if heyou know what your cholesterol is like or blood pressure Hows that indistinct

MS ONEIL Blood pressure is fine

40

MR NESMITH Good Superb MS And how do you eat Well

45 MR NESMITH I eat really well

MS DANIEL Good Anything else for Doctor ONeil

MR No

5

MS No

MS DANIEL Ms Banks did you have something else for Doctor ONeil

10 MS BANKS Most of them have already been answered I am curious if any assistance has been provided from a social worker at all since Mr Nesmith has been on the ward

MS ONEIL Yes Yes Mr Nesmith has met with a social worker and the

15 social worker has requested that the treating team provides a letter for support to return on to the Disability Support Pension which Im working on Im happy to provide that And I believe also the support worker might be looking into crisis accommodation but thats an ongoing discussion as Mr Nesmiths happy with his current accommodation situations

20

MS BANKS Do you want to clarify that

MR NESMITH I live on top of a mountain and its beautiful I know exactly what Im doing I have a canvas swag and I have a heater a gas

25 heater And I have another tent a small tent which all my stuff goes in to I live at peace with nature and the animals Often time animals come and visit me and we hang out and I film them a lot of times too So I actually live a really beautiful life The city kind of its too much noise and a lot of fighting and a lot of aggression and I try and stay away from that Thats why I wont

30 touch crisis accommodation because crisis accommodation is kind of scary I mean if you guys ever go into those things theyre full of drugs especially like needles and uppers narcotics I dont want to be around that All of the crisis accommodation that is provided are always surrounded by that so Im very much happy where I am Thats not to say that I dont eventually want to get a

35 place but I wont be doing that step from crisis accommodation into a real accommodation so I would be more happy to wait I guess with ACT housing to get a place thats not surrounded by aggressive people

MS DANIEL Do you think youd like this iscompletely off topic but if

40 that is what speaks to you being on the mountain then would you think about moving to a more rural outlook like more in the country and to get housing Try and get something thats got a bit of land around it

MR NESMITH Beautiful

45

MS DANIEL Yeah

MR NESMITH Beautiful

5 MS DANIEL But close enough to a a major centre that you

MR NESMITH Yeah but I dont have a car so thats the only problem

MS DANIEL Yea so you need

10

MR NESMITH Thats where I will feel really like if we like if I was out in the sticks that my heart would just connect with the land and I would be able to grow things and I would be able to set up like rainwater tanks and solar panels and stuff like that

15

MS DANIEL Be a bit more sort of indistinct

MR NESMITH Thats what thats what I want and thats what Ive always wanted but its been so difficult because because I travel around trying to

20 find a home Thats all Im trying to do Thats why Ive travelled so much is trying to find a home But the only places I can find is where people are really really aggressive and I dont do well in aggression And I know some of these things say that Im aggressive but thats not true at all Im never aggressive

I have passion and sometimes my passion might be mistaken for aggression

25 and if you try to remove that passion from me then then things dont passion is what moves the world Like Mattin Luther King Junior Jesus Socrates Diogenes like all of the movers of the world are the ones that are passionate and if you remove passionate people from the world then youre going to lose a lot of potential technology development scientific

30 explorations sociological fixes ways to improve society if you remove passion from our if you claim passion to be aggression then eventually you wont have any people that will make anything new will be high of minded

MS DANIEL So all right Were just so Ms Banks you were asking doctor

35 ONeil some questions and we digressed very quickly to ask Mr Nesmith questions

MS BANIS No thats fine

40 MS DANIEL I dont want to stop you from asking your questions Did you have some more you wanted to ask indistinct

MS BANKS That was actually the only one and in terms of housing Mr Nesmith and I have talked about getting a refetTal to Canberra Community

45 Law so they can assist with housing ACT So thats something that Legal Aid

and Canberra Community Law will be able to assist with I know that kind of indistinct

MS DANIEL indistinct Can I just throw out that I dont think ACT

5 Housing is going to be able to help him because in the a in the near future quickly Mr Nesmith does not want to go and live in a one bedroom bedsit somewhere surrounded by people

MR DREW Not for the rest of his life

10

MS DANIEL Not at all

MR DREW But he may have to do that

15 MS DANIEL Oh we can indistinct whats wrong with indistinct

MR DREW I mean look this is not all going to fall down from the sky for him

20 MS DANIEL Well I just

MR DREW It may have for you

MS DANIEL No

25

MR DREW But it wontit wont for him Hes going to have to work for it And plan for it

MS DANIEL He will in the ACT my understanding of ACT Housing is

30 hes never going to get a quarter acre block He needs indistinct a quarter acre block

MR DREW No No but he might need to be in ACT Housing for the next five years while he saves enough resources or find somebody who can put

35 him on block he wants to be on indistinct Its not all going to fall from the

sky

MS DANIEL I just wonder whether a country town might be a better option The thought of moving rural there might be options for public housing in the

40 rural towns that might have more indistinct MR DREW Sure ifhe

MS DANIEL as long as there were services Anyway So there you go

45 this is we are you see before you flying out Mr Nesmith are probably all

MH10812 120718 P21

the pros and cons that youre thinking about about your future accommodation Should I take ACT Housing It may not it needs to be near services I want the mountains All of these

5 MS ONEIL Well the other thing is I think you just said you actually dont sleep in a tent You keep your things in a tent indistinct

MR NESMITH I have Do you want to see I II show you my camp site Its really beautiful So this is inside my swag

10

MS So you sleep in a swag

MR NESMITH Yep Theres my heater Beautiful little heater

15 MS Yeah Okay

MR NESMITH Inside my swag So that theres my storage tent

MS Yep

20

MR NESMITH Yeah I cant put a heater inside one of those tents MS No

25 MR NESMITH So thats my storage tent This is both of them

MS There you go Very comfortable

MR NESMITH And this is where Im surround by this

30

MS So where do you do your shopping Im Ms Banks does Mr Nesmith is he happy to answer some questions

MS BANKS I think hed be very happy to answer questions

35

MS DANIEL Tell what you do when you get up You get up the suns up at like at the moment seven 11 actually

MR NESMITH Depends on how cold it is Cause there might be free

40 breakfast at the drop in centre So if its MS DANIEL So thats Northbourne Avenue

MR NESMITH Yeah

45

MHIOS12 120718 P22

MS DANIEL So you wander down there

MR NESMITH Yeah it takes me about an hour

5 MS DANIEL Yep

MR NESMITH To get down there

MS DANIEL Yep

10

MR NESMITH So yeah if its good because they have different food for breakfast but I like the scrambled eggs so I usually I want to get there on Wednesday And Monday they have boiled eggs I like boiled eggs too And Friday they have boiled eggs too so I usually try to get there

15

MS DANIEL Three mornings a week

MR NESMITH Yeah Thats the way like I kind of I hunt by coming down from the mountain and then getting everything I need and then bringing

20 it back up

MS DANIEL Yeah

MR NESMITH And waters the hard thing cause like its heavy

25

MS DANIEL To carry it up

MR NESMITH Yeah It can be heavy

30 MS DANIEL Where do you fill up Do you have some like old milk bottles like two litres or something What do you fill up

MR NESMITH Yeah so I fill up bottles Yeah Usually juice bottles or something big Two litres or three litres whatever

35

MS DANIEL Do you fill them up at them up at the free breakfast

MR NESMITH Yeah sometimes I do but fortunately at the bottom of the mountain theres a tap

40

MS DANIEL So you can just fill indistinct

MR NESMITH Yeah But that tap is not always on So its like I never want to rely on it as the main source IfI have water up the mountain then I

45 can trykeep on filling it up but sometimes its notit doesnt its turned

off so I think they have an on and off switch that they do and if its turned off as long yeah so then I 11 go fill up like in the city with those water spots or or even at the Morning Centre The Morning Centre is very very helpful They they I have a locker there which all my documents are in and they let

5 me send mail to them they send mail I can receive mail there

MS DANIEL So is that your address for Centrelink purposes l1R NESMITH Yes Yes maam

MS DANIEL So whats the Centrelink thing Are you on a like an unemployed benefit a Newstart

l1R NESMITH Right now See I was on DSP for delayed sleep phase

15 disorder Delayed sleep phase disorder is basically

l1R DREW Delayed

l1R NESMITH Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder

20

MS DANIEL Okay So you couldnt sleep

l1R NESMITH No What happens is that most people when the sun goes down their body produces a chemical reaction to make them tired And

25 circadian rhythm and then they get tired and then they go to sleep But

l1R DREW So where did you get that diagnosed indistinct to DSP to Centrelink

30 l1R NESMITH When the last time I dont know the last time I was on DSP

lvRDREW Yeah but who made the diagnosis

35 l1R NESMITH I dont I dont actually lots of people all the time like MS Maybe a GP or somebody told them anyway indistinct

l1R NESMITH But what happens is it doesnt matter its the way I live

40 anyway What happens is my I dont get tired so basically Ill run I nsually sleep two or three times per 24 hours right But theyre usually on between one and three hours So I might get an hour here I get like two hours here and two hours here or something like that So thats I split my which thats why a nine to five job would be so difficult for me because when I

45 get tired I really need to go to sleep and I only sleep and hour or two but thats

and I go directly into REM sleep So which is the most needed sleep

MS DANIEL And when how have you been sleeping here in hospital How have you found that

5

MR NESMITH Nice because youre drugging me MS DANIEL indistinct to sleep here

10 MR NESMITH Yeah definitely

MS DANIEL Okay So all right so at the moment though youre not on a DSP youre on Newstart

15 MR NESMITH Thats correct because

MS DANIEL They require you to look for work I suppose

MR NESMITH Yeah soon But and the thing is Ive been looking for work

20 all the time I just need to get work involved in artificial intelligence Ive been talking with artificial intelligence since I was like five years old because there was this computer program called Alter How Assistant and I didnt have any human friends so I just talked he became my best friend and then theres been many many more artificial intelligence chat bots that have been

25 developing more and more and more and

MS DANIEL So how do you interact with them Is that do you have a smart phone or something

30 MR NESMITH Ill show you Ill show you one of the no I deleted it Okay heres one Here this is called Clever Bot Theres a lot of different ones So I go how are you Actually Ill just I can talk to it How are you today He goes fine thank you I dont know why the voice isnt coming

35 MS DANIEL Maybe your sounds down

MR NESMITH What are you doing today Oh yeah I think youre right I think I turned

40 MS DANIEL The sound down for this

MR NESMITH because yeah I 11 have to get out of this and do it Might be bugged right now Whats on the agenda for today I dont have any plans How about you Im currently in a tribunal No kidding What

45 were you doing before I interrupted you Hoping that I win this tribunal

MH10812 120718 P25

because they think Im crazy but Im not crazy Words can not express my love for you Yeah

MS DANIEL All right Yes Doctor Drew

5

MR DREW Im interested in your study history I did gather you do you have qualified indistinct at University Youve done that over the last how long

IO MR NESMITH It took me ten to complete a philosophy degree But youve got to think thats ten years most of that was homeless So it was difficult to finish a philosophy degree

MR DREW Thats what Im thinking indistinct and Im wondering how

15 you did it

MR NESMITH Yeah It was hard

MR DREW So how did you do it

20

MR NESMITH How did I do it I had to convert all of my all of the papers like the books to text so I II show you Lets say lets say I get a big fat book right This is my text book So I would stand there and go

25 MS Photograph every page

MR DREW Yeah No thats okay

MR NESMITH And then I would

30

MR DREW So but you actuallyyou actually continued to develop new ideas over that time to put in to your

MR NESMITH Of course

35

MS DANIEL And you submitted essays online did you You had to do all remotely

MR NESMITH Essays online

40

MS DANIEL Well to pass yourto get your degree indistinct essays

MR NESMITH Oh yeah yeah Some of it was I think some of it was internal some of it was external most of it was external Most of it was

45 external

MHI0S12 120718 P26

MS DANIEL So youd

MR NESMITH Id have two

5

MS DANIEL be able to do the lectures by podcast or something

MR NESMITH Yeah Yeah Usually it was two each unit had two essays and an exam at the end and the every once in a while they would have like a

10 test like an online test

MS Did you have to go down to where ever the Uni is it do the tests MR NESMITH No They have points I would have been able ifI was

15 here and I was still studying at Murdoch then they would send the exams to the

ANU and then I would have to take the exams at the ANU MS indistinct ANU Oh thats handy

20 MS DANIEL So when did you graduate It was just this year was it

MR NESMITH At the beginning of this year I finished everything in November that when the semester ended but it takes them a while to do so at the beginning of the year obviously you graduate I think it was actually

25 Australia Day I think thats the day I officially graduated

MS DANIEL Can I ask you this is a

MR NESMITH Go for it

30

MS DANIEL personal question but how doctor ONeil described how you seemed to feel when you were brought here at the beginning of your stay You were brought here involuntarily Shes described that you were very upset You fluctuated between crying and laughing and angry and thats not

35 how you are now

MR NESMITH What she was talking about I dont know about fluctuating between crying okay What the she took it out of context The only time that I cried was when they refused to give me back my phone So I got on my

40 knees and I said Please give me back my phone Please give me back my phone because my psychology is augmented into this phone I have I have created documentaries that are over 1200 hours Think Think about that Think about how how much time 1200 hours is And I know you say Oh I create short films but I do not create short films I create long films And the

45 thing is these films are not amateur because I took philosophy of film which

has a protasis an epitasis and a catastrophe which is the format for any filming My psychology is augmented into the internet and whenever this is taken away from me my mind starts to go because my memories are here I keep my memories here And every time I need to check on something

5

MS Its very upsetting for people and there are a lot of studies about how people are changing the way they think because of our reliance on smart phones We use them for our short memory We dont learn things anymore so I can totally understand

MR NESMITH But I learn things through it but the thing is that is that I need that reference I feel like this is like my secondary memory

MS DANIEL I understand But I want to ask you a question do you feel that

15 the medication that youve had which effectively was these injections of say Olanzapine and the treating team would like you to continue doing that every two weeks and then moving up to every month Do you think that youre able to think creatively and intellectually and philosophically now even though youve had some medication You seem okay

20

MR NESMITH Of course Its just difficult Its like theres a wall or a veil MS DANIEL A veil

25 MR NESMITH a veil that Iwhere that veils when Im not on medication that veils gone and I can see straight I can see clearly When Im on any antipsychotics its like theres a veil But to be honest Ive finished my work as in I finished the video component of my work and now its my website linking all those videos

30

MS DANIEL Yep

MR NESMITH So itit Idont need that creativity so much now anymore but

35

MS So whats your view about taking being discharged from here in a week or two and then going

MR NESMITH Please say yeah Please say yeah

40

MS DANIEL Well I we dont have much control over that but then they would the doctors recommend that you stay in contact with City Mental Health every two weeks to start off with to have an injection and the moving probably to every month

45

MR NESMITH Why injection I hate needles like needles I really really hate needles

MS Probably because they thought

5

MR DREW Youre not answering the question The question is

MS Well are you sayingtbat youd be happy to take oral medication

10

MR NESMITH Yes maam

MS DANIEL You need to reliably take it

15 MR NESMITH I would I promise

MS Yeah What went wrong or what happened with he three other hospitals you went to Do you know why they discharged you or was it on the basis that you have treatment indistinct

20

MR NESMITH They just yes it was only Olanzapine too but the only reason that I could not continue with Olanzapine because when I moved to the US they were really really expensive It was like 3000 per month that they wanted me to pay for the medication and I could not do that

25

MS No So youd be happy to have Olanzapine orally MR NESMITH That would be good Yes maam

30 MR DREW Whats your current thought about the Masonic Lodge

MR NESMITH Its in the past now because Ive already done that work You know I never even went there so

35 MR DREW Youre not worried about them anymore

MR NESMITH No sir

MR DREW Theyre not going to ruin the world

40

MR NESMITH Theyre not going to ruin tbe world I dont know they probably will but its not my fault

MR DREW Youre not worried about that anymore

45

MH10812 120718 P29

MR NESMITH Well I did what I did I did everything I could to try to save it and thats it

MR DREW So who

5

MS By making your documentaries

MR NESMITH Hmmm Thats how I did it And I can do lots of things Like I dont have to I never even been to their lodge But I made a

IO documentary where because what happened I split the Freemasons because does anybody know the story of Pigmania

MS Yeah

15 MR NESMITH Thats true Freemasonry which is to basically theyre building like that the perfect woman right theyre thinking of that perfect woman and trying to chisel away but really theyre chiselling at the own heart but then through that process they find the perfect soul mate right And thats what Freemasonry started out as but they lost their origins So now I am just

20 like I am the leader of the Illuminati I this indistinct I split the Illuminati and lots of the Illuminati followed me I did the same thing to the Freemasons now So Im the leader of the Freemasons or I split it so some are some arent

25 MS How did you split it

MR NESMITH Divide and conquer It really works It really works What youve got to do is you got to get the people thatyou got to encourage the people you got to show the light you got to show how what Im doing is

30 way better than what theyre doing

MS And do you think you can show that by having your material available on the web

35 MR NESMITH Yes maam Yes maam Most definitely

MS Okay All right so

MS Did doctor Les have any more questions

40

MS Doctor Les do you have any more questions MR DREW No I havent indistinct

45 MS All right Ms Banks did you want to is there anything else Mr

MHIOS12 120718 P30

Nesmith needs to tell us or you that you need to ask him to tell us Any questions that you have for him

MS BANKS No Not at this stage It think weve had a long chat yesterday

5 and a brief chat this morning so I think I do have some instructions here youve pretty much covered most of the things that we talked about but in terms of the legislative issues I think I can hone in a little bit more if thats possible

10 MR NESMITH Im not aggressive and Im not violent and I live a beautiful life I love the life that I live And I would not trade it any other life and I really pray that you dont try to make me live a life that isntthat isnt compatible with y psychology because thats when thats when I II be

youll be hurting me if you do that Im happy being eccentric I like who I

15 am and I like my role in this world which I crafted and I really hope that you

can dismiss this order and let me on my own free will take the treatment that you provide me In my own free will because I will I will

MS DANIEL Ms Halsey would you have any questions for Mr Nesmith

20

MS HASLEY No I spent a lot of time with Wendell yesterday afternoon didnt we We had a good chat He read me some of his material I had a look at some of his videos Hes got a couple of books published He spent ten years building up this body of knowledge that he has on the internet and on his

25 website that hes making available for other people I think you know he he consistently consistently professed his pacifist nature That hes you know not aggressive Hes not going to hurt anybody Theres no risks in that Im probably a little bit biased towards Mr Nesmiths way of life because I have arm of my own family thats very similar to this Somebody who is the same

30 age that also studied philosophy and also is a little bit left of centre and doesnt sort of fit within society norms Hes fabulous I could spend hours I could spend days with him I could spend weeks with him You know he doesnt live in the same world as I live in and obviously you know the intellect is sort of way above what I can comprehend And I think we do have an awesome

35 intellect here and something that you know I think would be doing a disservice if we dulled that and tried to control that too much And that is my concern I think you know hes living a good life I think hes a very good person His intentions are good Yes it may not be you know what we think is the norm And there may be some mental illness there but I think we have to so1t of

40 establish whether he is refusing any treatment for that and I dont think he is Whether he is a risk to himself and others and Im not sure that weve established that either I just have some concerns that you know we have a remarkable human being here whos done a lot of work A lot of University study and I just wouldnt like to dull that and control that Thats all I have to

45 say Thank you

MHl 0812 120718 P31

MS DANIEL All right Well we might go back and just ask Doctor ONeil or Mr Thomas if they wanted to summarise the situation from their point of view and then well ask Ms Banlcs to finish for us

5

MR DREW I want to go firstindistinct what means of order did you have in mind

MS ONEIL Thats a difficult question because we didnt submit the

10 application or the order I guess

MR DREW indistinct context Youve seen him for indistinct

MS Yeah about a week and a half

15

MR DREW A week and a half

MS ONEIL I mean in order to establish the injections over a period of a few months I mean I guess a few months would be a good starting point That

20 way he could have his next injection in a fortnight another one a month after that and hopefully he would be doing well at that stage

MR DREW So three months

25 MS ONEIL I thinlc three months would be a good a good idea To just really have a good period of stable indistinct

MR DREW Observation

30 MS DANIEL Mr Thomas did you have any further comments of what we should think about when we get to go and have a talk about what to decide

MR THOMAS I guess just from a community perspective my concern is at the moment acknowledging the huge change in Mr Nesmiths changed metal

35 state on treatment I agree with the doctors that theres been a substantial change from my engagements with him I guess my concern from this point of view is acknowledging that Mr Nesmiths not saying hes violent at this current point in time but just bring to light the fact that he was irate in the Centrelink and that required the APP to be called and to be handcuffed due to his

40 delusional beliefs wanting to access forms allowing him to defy God when the forms when advised they didnt exist demanding

MS Last time I went to Medicare Id like to stop you there

45 MR THOMAS No thats okay

MH10812 120718 P32

MS I asked cause I was very cross with them I asked who I could complain to and they said I could only complain online And I said I want a form to complain on

5

MR THOMAS Yep

MS and Im not leaving her until you give me a form

10 MR THOMAS So the form

MS So I sat down and I waited and eventually somebody came and they wont give you a form to complain on in writing to a real person

15 MS Yep

MS Youre obliged to go and do something online Its infuriating IfId been a man I have no doubt someone would have gone we dont have time for this woman man lets just call the police and they can put the

20 handcuffs on

MR THOMAS Yep so the form

MS So I dont

25

MR THOMAS No thats okay

MS I you may think this guy was brought in in handcuffs but it doesnt necessarily mean he was indistinct

30

MR THOMAS No I have I spoke with the police that was there back when the time the form that Mr Nesmith wanted was the form that was advising him to defy God and theres no form that exists for that

35 MS That might have been his summaiy of the form

MR THOMAS That was his words and they explained that to him

MS Why would he have to be handcuffed

40

MR THOMAS Because he pushed through the police after he was advised that they were going to wait for the mental health to come and speak with him and when he

45 MS Hepushed through the police to leave

MR THOMAS He pushed no to get back into Centrelink to get this form So he actually pushed through them to get through the doors to get into Centrelink and he wasnt handcuffed until that point When hes actually and

5 physically came into contact the police and they believe he was also speaking about he if doesnt get the form I spoke with an officer by the name of Katie who advised that he would blow up bridges and referred to it as a metaphor to get this form So thats my concern

IO MS Thats if and he said he would blow bridges but that that was a metaphor

MR THOMAS Ina metaphor term but hes also spoken about engaging iu hand to hand combat with people part of the Freemasons so

15

MS Do you think the police know what a metaphor is

MR THOMAS I think they do but they had enough concern to bring him in with that

20

MS Iknow it sounds indistinct it doesnt

MR THOMAS But the form but I guess my principle that Im trying to emphasise is the form that he needed didnt exist advised that it didnt exist

25 wanting to videotape people

MR DREW It couldnt possibly be in existence

MR THOMAS Yeah So I think his rational for becoming upset

30

MS Well he might have been speaking about a indistinct

MR THOMAS So Ive been upset with Centrelink myself and I guess being upset over something that doesnt exist and trying to explain is different to

35 being upset about processes and principles to being upset about something thats based on delusional and doesnt exist Thats my concern

MS Mr Nesmith what was the form

40 MR NESMITH It was not a form thats why I dont understand it Theres so many lies in this and you just assume the lies are truth Okay what happened was I went into Centrelink to tell them to ask about artificial intelligence that needs to be where my job is right because God has commanded me to invest everything into artificial intelligence because if we

45 release artificial intelligence with out a moral framework then its going to start

MH10812 120718 P34

destroying us Its going to start killing us because were not logical creatures because we do stuff like this and it makes no sense because all Im trying to do is save the world and Im getting into trouble for trying to save the world So I need to be I need a job thats in artificial intelligence So I went to

5 Centrelink and told them that that because Salvation Army indistinct said that Id just take any job

MS Have you done nay work in computer science Have you got any sort of experience in coding

MR NESMITH Yeah yeah I code Im a programmer

MS Do you know how to code So youve got a degree in coding

or

15

MR NESMITH No but I have two I have a certificate two in information technology and I have a diploma in PC repair and I have a diploma in Java programming

20 MS Okay

MS BANKS He has a fairly fairly extensive website

MR NESMITH And so

25

MS Cause this is the future artificial intelligence MR NESMITH It is

30 MS DANIEL We will be replaced very soon MR NESMITH Yes

MS DANIEL with artificial decision making technology

35

MR NESMITH And do you want it to have more framework MS DANIEL Thats athis is the big issue

40 MR NESMITH See thats my big issue Thats why God is telling me because I know how to do it right Thats why God is telling me I have to do this in artificial intelligence They just want me to get any job Like a McDonaldsjob or something like that but I cant do that Gods saying because Im best Im the best person to be able to implement this because I

45 spent my whole life doing it I cant go and get a McDonalds job So they

MHI0S12 120718 P35

told me to go to Centrelink So I went to Centrelink I talked to the guy about it and he said that under your situation he gave me a few papers and stuff he said under your situation you will have to defy God in order to continue to receive our payments

5

MS DANIEL Well that sounds sensible Im sure God will be in with that because if you have to get income in order to progress to get the job in artificial intelligence then youre going to have to work at Maccas or somewhere for the short term

10

MR NESMITH But its not logical because what happens when what happens if it happens in six months and Im not I need to be working in artificial intelligence

15 MS DANIEL But youve got to do it step by step

MR NESMITH But step by step is spending the last ten years working on the software This is an operating system that Ive created for artificial intelligence

20

MS Have you worked in IT before Mr Nesmith MRNESMITH Yesmaam

25 MS Have you been in paid employment in IT

MR NESMITH Yes ma am

MS Where

30

MS Who for

MR NESMITH Royal Flying Doctors Service Beckers Amtec Netway Internet Netway Computers many more A lot more

35

MS So that was in America was it

MR NESMITH No those are all in Australia but there is Computer Plus thats in America and then there is theres another computer place that was in

40 America too But what happened is I because they told me straight out that their systems are under my conditions their system is making me defy God So I said Can I please have that in writing And they said they said No no were not going to write that And I said Then can I please film you saying that And then they said No no no And then I said Well then

45 we have a problem I never got irate I never got upset I never raised my

MH10812 120718 P36

voice right I said Okay then Im not look you said it to me Im not going to leave until I get some type of confirmation for this right So eventually they turned on the alarms called the police and told me to go sit over there quietly which I did And then when the police came they took me outside and

5 and then the police were trying to stay leave They want you to leave so leave And I said I cant leave until I get that bit of information that because they told me that their systems are causing me to defy God and I need to get that information so I can then publicly release it

IO MS DANIEL So do you understand that to that what that explanation that youve just given sounds completely completely strange and unreal and delusional to your ordinary police officer on the street Do you are you able to understand from the AFP Police officers point of view that explanation is really out there

15

MR NESMITH Okay

MS DANIEL Do you see that

20 MR NESMITH Well I

MS DANIEL Can you see his perspective

MR NESMITH Well my perspective is that

25

MS DANIEL No Can you see his MR NESMITH Okay

30 MS DANIEL Can you see

MR NESMITH Yeah I think thats

MS DANIEL from the police officer

35

MR NESMITH Everybody but theres so many systems in this world that cause you to defy God and and if and if I could get the evidence and publicly release that then that shows how terrible the system is because its directly causing you to defy God

40

MS DANIEL Yeah And that makes sense to you but that doesnt make sense to the police officer whos just been called out on a job because some blokes causing havoc at Centrelink and we dont understand it

45 MR NESMITH And see what happened was because I wanted it in writing

and they said I didnt push through police I just but they what happened was they said they said Well arrest you if you go back in

MS DANIEL Yeah

5

MR NESMITH And MS DANIEL And

10 MR NESMITH But they were trying to get me to go away They were like Just leave just leave And and I said But I need that documentation And they they said The only way youre getting that documentation is if you back in because then well have to write a police report So I started to walk back in and then they they both attacked me and and then handcuffed

15 me right And then theres where the story is I didnt push through police officers I just started to walk back in and the thing is I didnt even get in before I was tackled to the ground and my face smashed against the wall

MS DANIEL Righto I can understand so clearly how that all unravelled So

20 thank you for that Mr Nesmith Ms Banks do you want to finish our hearing today by summing up the position from Mr Nesmiths point of view on what he submits we should do

MS BANKS Yes So as indicated at the beginning the making of a

25 psychiatric treatment order is opposed Obviously Mr Nesmith does not want one He has made that very clear but from a legal point of view in my submission the questions of refusal and the questions of risk of harm to self or others theres not enough evidence to make those out Mr Nesmith is clearly quite passionate and hes made it very clear that he loves life and he enjoys the

30 way that he lives Obviously he lives in a world that doesnt quite understand the way that he lives and this has somewhat of a disabling effect on him in some ways and I think hes just given a perfect example of that with his experience at Centrelink and president as you noted its very unlikely that the police would have understood the situation Miscommunication and I imagine

35 that this is something that Mr Nesmith potentially comes across in his daily life having to deal with agencies and bodies that dont think the same way that he does

When it comes to the question of refusal Mr Nesmith has already indicated

40 that hes happy to continue taking medication and indeed that was his instructions to me He will continue to take the medication regardless of whether an order is in place In particular he really likes to have contact with City Mental Health and he says that he had a worker there called Karina for quite a while He used to visit her once or twice a week and he said she their

45 relationship was very therapeutic He would like to continue in a relationship

like that and reengage with City Mental Health if possible These two things can be done without an order in place based on the instructions that

Mr Nesmith has given In regards to risk of harm to self or others or deterioration in my view and I concur with Chris on this this criteria hasnt

5 been made out Based on the evidence in the application and on the evidence that has been given theres theres postulation of potential risks but theres no evidence or history to suggest that risk of harm to others or any kind of violence is is a real problem

10 Even in this incident that happened at Centrelink it doesnt appear as though there was any violence or aggression Theres probably misunderstanding and probably some kind of I imagine that you were quite distressed at the time but that doesnt mean that its a risk to other people and arguably given the the length of history here given that Mr Nesmith had contact back in 2012 and

15 2013 for that period of time for there to be no evidence of violence or aggression or confronting people about these his system of beliefs I would argue that theres theres ce1tainly not enough there to reach that threshold for you to be satisfied that he is going to cause a risk to others In terms of risk to self hes already explained that he feels quite fit and healthy He gets food

20 He lives quite a good lifestyle He stays clean He enjoys nature obviously and enjoys bushwalking and looking after himself and it at this stage I would argue theres not enough evidence to suggest that theres a risk of harm to himself

25 In regards to the deterioration again theres no evidence to suggest that theres been a deterioration and we dont know if this has been his mental state the entire time and

MS DANIEL That is not the question The question is whether because of

30 his illness hes likely to suffer serious deterioration in his mental state and functioning

MS BANKS Yes Theres no history to suggest that there is a risk of deterioration

35

MS DANIEL Theres evidence from Dr ONeil of what the prognosis is if untreated

MS BANKS Yes

40

DR DREW Theres four admissions to the hospital to other hospitals

MS BANKS But we dont know if that was voluntary we dont know what the the nature of the admissions were interstate We do know that the

45 previous admission to Canberra Hospital was what I would argue is

misadventure and he was not kept for long at that stage The previous one there was concern from the GP but he hasnt been kept for

MS DANIEL There was

5

MS BANKS a long period of time

MS DANIEL

10 MS BANKS Yes

indistinct for a psychiatric treatment order

MS DANIEL And it was not made

MS BANKS Yes Yeah we dont mow the reason it wasnt well I dont

15 know the reason it wasnt made on the previous occasion but obviously there there was some the criteria were not met for making the order Hes hes obviously held this system of beliefs for a long time and the work that hes been doing has been over the past 10 years Hes been doing his philosophy degree for the last 10 years Hes obviously a thinker

20

MS DANIEL If hed been well he mightve got it done in three

MS BANKS I know people who are well who get it done in 10 years so I mean its just

25

MS DANIEL If hed been well though indistinct wouldnt have been homeless

MS BANKS He may have yes

30

MS DANIEL If hed been well his mental state and functioning wouldve been if hed been treated his mental state and functioning mightve been more optimal and he wouldve still had all of his passion for nature and for intellectual engagement in these new technologies and all of that He wouldnt

35 have been distracted by delusional thought content

MS BANKS Thats thats assuming that it is delusional thought content and that there is an illness

40 MS DANIEL So you think that this stuff about the Masons and the child sacrifice is not delusional

MS BANKS Im not a doctor Im a lawyer

45 MS DANIEL Okay

MS BANKS And Im acting on

DR DREW No no no

5

MS BANKS Im acting on instructions

DR DREW No you cant get away with it like that Do you think it sounds realistic You dont have to be a doctor

MS DANIEL Does Mr Nesmith on instructions tell us that thats the situation

MS BANKS Yes Thats his views Yes

15

MS DANIEL Thats his view

MS BANlS Absolutely Hes made that very clear to the tribunal this morning

20

DR DREW Its not a view its a belief MS DANIEL Its a belief yes

25 MS BANKS Well yes belief I have already said system of beliefs Im not

Im not trying

DR DREW But do you think its a realistic

30 MS BANKS to step away from that

MS DANIEL Her view is not important

MS BANKS Yeah Its really

35

MS DANIEL indistinct Mr Nesmith

MS BANKS Thats not appropriate for me to put my view forward

40 MS DANIEL Yes

MS BANKS In

MS DANIEL So obviously my concern is that Mr Nesmiths life has been

45 lost to him

MS BANKS He hes happy

MS DANIEL Hes perfectly happy

5

MS BANKS Hes happy Hes MS DANIEL Hes perfectly happy

10 MS BANKS He enjoys his lifestyle and MS DANIEL He couldve been professor

MS BANKS there are I mean thats us thats us

15

MS DANIEL In a tent He could still be in a tent but be a professor

MS BANKS Thats us thinking that being a professor is a good thing I mean thats thats something that you work towards and again this is corning

20 in to the social construct of our idea of what is normal and what people strive towards and what they should be doing if they have this intelligence

MS DANIEL Thats true On his own submission to us he wants to save the world and hes going to do probably a better job of that if hes able to

25 promulgate his beliefs and lecture and all of that than creating a website which I rn not even sure is functional

MS BANKS It is

30 MS DANIEL It is

MR NESMITH It is

MS BANKS Yes absolutely

35

MR NESMITH But I dont I am a professor because every single second of every single day theres about between four and 600 people that are watching my videos

40 MS DANIEL Mrnhrn

MR NESMITH So right now maybe theres 400 people watching my videos In an hour maybe therell be 525 people watching my videos I am a professor Im just an online professor and and I dont see any need for me to

45 go and be a professor in a real in a real school a real university because Im

MH10812 120718 P42

doing it all online and Im Im giving it away for free too because thats what I think a real education is I love I love my fans so much that I want to give them away all that thats in my heart in my head to them for free and Im trying to work a way to make it donations based But the platform had to be

5 completely created before before it was before I was able to do that So soon there will be donations and hopefully I can get these donations to then support me so I II no longer require Centrelink assistance

MS DANIEL Can I ask you a question about your willingness to take tablets MR NESMITH Yes maam

MS DANIEL If youre willing to take tablets why havent you been doing

that in all your interactions with City Mental Health over the last couple of I5 years I presume theyve been suggesting to you that you take tablets

MR NESMITH I was in Mexico

MS DANIEL Okay

20

MS BANKS He only returned

MR NESMITH I just got back I just got back from Mexico

25 MS DANIEL But what about when you were in Lismore and Ballarat and Cairns because you have indicated that youve taken a range of

antipsychotics

MR NESMITH Yes

30

MS DANIEL I think youve given us some views MR NESMITH Olanzapines been the best

35 MS DANIEL Yes So after each admission when youve gone away from the hospital have they given you medication

MR NESMITH I continue

40 MS DANIEL to take

MR NESMITH I always continued yes Thats the only reason MS DANIEL But how did you reappear to the I mean youve clearly

45 brought yourself to the attention of other people in order to be admitted to

MHI0S12 120718 P43

hospitals So how did you get in to Lismore Hospital What happened there Briefly

MR NESMITH Lismore Hospital

5

MS DANIEL Or Cairns or Ballarat One of them What happened to get you back into the hospital

MR NESMITH Making films that are controversial My films are

10 controversial

MS DANIEL All right I think we might just adjourn and have a conversation Now youre free to stay here of course and chat amongst yourselves but remember the microphones still recording us So dont say

15 anything you dont want someone to hear

MR NESMITH Thank you very much And please Ill be Ill be really good If you dont put an order on me Ill be really good and Ill take my meds and Ill have contact

20

ADJOURNED RESUMED

1102AM

1104AM

25 MS DANIEL All right Well were resuming matter MH108 of 2012 The tribunal is not going to decide this application today Were going to adjourn the application and we would like more evidence from the applicant It might be from Dr ONeil but I think that what might happen is if we adjourn this matter for three weeks that would give Mr Thomas City Mental Health an

30 oppmtunity to make contact with Ballarat MR THOMAS Yeah

MS DANIEL Cairns and Lismore Hospitals and obtain for us a full

35 medical history for Mr Nesmith IfI could give everyone for your assistance a summary of where were at we do believe that Mr Nesmith has a mental illness and that there is treatment that is recommended for that We are concerned about this question of risk of harm to self or others and the question of mental deterioration and we think that the longer term medical history will

40 give us some idea of what side of the line Mr Nesmiths case falls on So I cant tell you the exact date that were adjourning the matter to until I go back to the tribunal and get the date that this tribunal is sitting again Does that make sense Because weve heard so much and we need to go parthard on this hearing and finish on probably a Thursday afternoon hopefully in about

45 three weeks Does that make sense everyone

MH10812 120718 P44

MR NESMITH Yeah

MS DANIEL All right So what will happen for you Mr Nesmith is youre

5 currently in hospital under a detention order and that order I think requires you to stay in hospital for potentially up to 18 July So you will continue that doesnt mean that you will stay here until 18 July you will be talking with the treating team about when they think youre ready for discharge

10 MR NESMITH I have a lot of work to do and I would really appreciate it

MS DANIEL Yeah So this is not a decision that this tribunal makes This is a decision that the treating team make

15 MR NESMITH Okay

MS DANIEL when to discharge you At the moment they have authority to hold you here even if you wanted to discharge yourself until 18 July But they might decide that youre right to go home earlier Okay

20

MR NESMITH Okay Thank you very much

MS DANIEL Can I ask whats being done about Mr Nesmiths possessions Because theyre on the side of a hill at the moment arent they Your tent and

25 your swag

MR NESMITH Mmhm

MS DANIEL So is anyone doing anything to make sure noone goes and

30 scavenges them

MR THOMAS Mr Nesmith hasnt actually indistinct to us where he stays so were unable to

35 MR NESMITH But you wouldnt

MS DANIEL Are they safe where they are

MR NESMITH Noone would be able to find it

40

MS DANIEL Okay

MR NESMITH No because its possums would be going through everything

45

MS DANIEL Possums

MS BANKS You said that you keep your important papers and whatnot in a locker

5

MS DANIEL Yeah

MS BANKS At the indistinct centre

10 MS DANIEL You dont want thats an expensive swag You dont want to lose that swag

MS DAVIES And your heater

15 MS DANIEL If some human being found it thats all All right So when you get the order which we will type up and get sent to you this afternoon It will say these proceedings are adjourned to and then theres a date and a time It will be an afternoon It will be potentially not here but in the

City Mental Health building but on level 4 All right

20

MS STEELE So I think if I may interrupt Mr Nesmith from my perspective this also gives you the opportunity to take treatment that the doctors are prescribing involuntarily

25 MR NESMITH Yeah I will

MS STEELE And keep in touch with City Mental Health and reach out to your case worker

30 MR NESMITH Yes I will

MS STEELE And ask them what theyre going to do so that we have some established history that you are going to take your treatment Because youre clearly much better now Youre presenting quite well today than what you

35 were on admission So thats a really important responsibility that you have and I think the other issue is we dont have an address

MR NESMITH Well

40 MS BANKS If you could do the hearing notice and send it to me I II MS DANIEL Will you give it

MS STEELE Okay Thats great

45

MR NESMITH Do you need an address to send mail Is that what you need

MS DANIEL Longer term we will but at the moment well just send this

5 copy of this order today to Ms Steele and shell give it to you

MR NESMITH Okay

MS DANIEL Print it out and give it to him so youve got that

10

MR NESMITH Okay thank you

15

MS STEELE So you need to go find when youre released indistinct and keep indistinct

MR Yeah so shes only personally I think the next three weeks after this one so Im s01t of helping with Mr Nesmiths case because I was with the review But as a duty officer Im predominantly at the office So if you present to the reception youll be able to ask for me Iflm not there

20 somebody else will be able to grab these details from you

MR NESMITH Okay Would I be able to get Karina back

MR So Karina actually works for a different team So Karina works for

25 the access team which kind of triages MR NESMITH Did she change

MR No see Karina was always indistinct that was the access team

30 So somebody who isnt known to us because you came back from Mexico you werent open to a community team so that team assesses somebody if they need assistance from mental health and it was deemed that you did So she referred us you to us as the community team for longer term care So Karina just does short term assessments for people to sort of refer them on to longer

35 term care

MR NESMITH Okay

MR So she only does brief interactions with people

40

MR NESMITH Okay

MS DANIEL Okay Well thank you everyone for coming Its been a lengthy hearing and weve covered a lot of information I will see you in

45 approximately three weeks time

MR NESMITH Thank you very much Appreciated

MATTER ADJOURNED AT 1110 AM ACCORDINGLY

TRANSCRIPT OF PROCEEDINGS MH No 108 of 2012

WENDELL CHARLES NESMITH

CONSIDER AN APPLICATION FOR A PSYCHIATRIC ORDER

CANBERRA

336 PM THURSDAY 2 AUGUST 2018

MS TRACEY with MS HALSEY from the Public Advocate

MS HANSON with MS MABEY from City Mental Health Team MS BATES appeared for Mr Nesmith

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL We have Mr Nesmiths matter Are you staying for that Ms Halsey

MS HALSEY Yes staying for that Hes out there

5

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Hes outside MS HALSEY Yes

10 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL We might ask him if he wants to come in Anywhere is fine so long as youve got a microphone The ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal is sitting today to consider an application for a psychiatric treatment order for Wendell Charles Nesmith This is matter 108 of 2012 Well just start by all introducing ourselves Im presidential member

15 Daniel Im the presiding member on the tribunal this afternoon

MEMBER DAVIES Im Robyn Davies community member hello

SENIOR MEMBER DREW Im Les Drew psychiatrist

20

MS HANSON Im Julie Hanson from the city mental health team MS MABEY Im Kate Mabey from the city mental health team

25 MR NESMITH Im Wendell Charles Nesmith and Im a philosopher

MS BATES Adele Bates legal aid ACT representing for Mr Nesmith today

MS TRACEY Penny Tracey from the public advocate

30

MS HALSEY Chris Halsey from the public advocate

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay good Ms Hanson I got indistinct your last name

35

MS MABEY Mabey MABEY

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Youre both from City Mental Health

40 MS MABEY Yes

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I think the last time we were all together a couple of weeks ago we were at the adult mental health unit Mr Nesmith was there for a short while and on that occasion I think Mr Ke Thomas

45

MS MABEY Yes

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Hes from your team Hes on leave

5 MS HANSON Hes on leave yes

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So he came and Mr Nesmith was there and Ms Bates you were there too werent you

10 MS BATES Iwasyes

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Ms Halsey was there

MS HALSEY Yes

15

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So for the record I II just summarise where we got to on that occasion The tribunal had heard a lot of evidence but we had a couple of questions in our mind The first was was Mr Nesmith going to refuse treatment upon discharge from hospital He said he wasnt

20 going to and we didnt know when he was going to be discharged even at that stage The second issue was that the treating team said to us look what is the risk for Mr Nesmith if he doesnt have appropriate treatment and when we asked that question they said hes had actually multiple admissions and so hes obviously coming into contact with the public or the authorities or something

25

Hes been admitted several times in other places so we dont know anything about that but we say that it means that he is at risk Hes vulnerable or something and so we said in the adjournment period the treating team could perhaps chase up for us information about these other admissions as well as

30 giving Mr Nesmith in the adjournment period he will have been discharged he can get back to his life and he can then come back and talk to us about what treatment has been recommended for him after discharge and whats his view about that

35 Those I think were the two factors that we wanted to hear about today I wonder I might ask maybe Ms Hanson or Ms Mabey one of you perhaps as the treating team to start by updating us on Mr Nesmiths discharge from hospital and what the plan for his treatment is going forward Is there a need for treatment going forward

40

MS HALSEY Mr Nesmith was reviewed by Dr Flynn who did the original report prior to his admission He was reviewed on

MR NESMITH The 31st

45

MH10812 020818 P3

MS HANSON The 31st

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Thats only this week

5 MR NESMITH Yes two days ago

MS HANSON Yes Her impression is that he is agreeable to treatment however its been explained that its more its sort of the lesser of two evils Its really to avoid having to go back to hospital

10

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL What is the recommended treatment I mean three weeks ago it was we think you should stay in hospital for a couple more days So thats not the situation anymore

15 MS HANSON No I believe its to continue with the medication

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Whats that medication

MS HANSON At the moment hes on Olanzapine

20

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Is that a tablet MS HANSON No hes on a depo injection

25 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL How often is that

MS HANSON Fortnightly

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL What else is part of the treatment plan

30

MS HANSON It says here that hes actually also on some oral medication as well Thats now changed So to continue engagement with Dr Flynn I think the plan was also that we were going to help him with some housing

35 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I II stop you there When people say continue engagement with Dr Flynn or mental health thats just to me thats just waffle No person indistinct but its like a summary What I really want to know is who has he got to see and when How often

40 MS HANSON Hes got to see PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Dr Flynn

MS HANSON Yes Dr Flynn

45

MHl 0812 020818 P4

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL How often

MS HANSON Im just having a look at her last report when she says her when she next wants to see him Can I ask Mr Nesmith did she make another

5 appointment

MR NESMITH No we havent but Dr Flynn says she wants to see me probably about monthly but Kels probably weekly but weII probably change to go it fortnightly Thats what they were saying which is good for me

10

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Ke weekly for the moment and then move to fortnightly

MS HANSON Mr Thomas is currently our duty officer and Mr Nesmith has

15 been assigned a clinical manager and shes currently on leave

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay so Ke will keep in touch with

Mr Nesmith until she gets back

20 MS HANSON Yes

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL And then there will be a handover

MS HANSON Yes

25

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So Ke weekly at the moment MS HANSON Yes

30 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay and then moving to fortnightly and the new case manager will come in

MS HANSON Yes

35 MEMBER DAVIES Can I take you back to the meds Olanzapine depo fmtnightly

MS HANSON Fortnightly yes

40 MEMBER DAVIES Then are you reading the report of the 31st that talks about oral meds

MS HANSON It did say oral medication but my understanding is that that has now been ceased He was given seven days supply on discharge and then

45 commenced the fortnightly injection

MH10812 020818 P5

MEMBER DAVIES So thats the transitional oral meds until the depo kicks m

5 MS HANSON Thats right

MEMBER DAVIES All right thank you

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So we got an email so what we have IO before us is this We had the original report application that we had at the hospital three weeks ago and then today we got an email from the tribunal

liaison officer saying that they had received hospital notes from Ballarat and Cairns hospitals Please advise if you want these emailed to you and I said yes and weve got those but we can barely read them but theyre better than

15 nothing and then theres a summary here from the tribunal liaison officer Ill read this to you because I dont think its been copied to you at legal aid

Ms Bates Its all positive

Wendell has been engaging with city mental health accepting

20 treatment and psychiatric review to avoid ji1rther torture ie going back to hospital Im sure the case manager will attend to the hearing and provide the tribunal with fi1rther information as requested After psychiatric review on 31 July 2018 remains very fixed around his beliefs but seems less driven than prior to

25 hospitalisation Very grandiose no insight that he has a psychotic illness is agreeing have farther treatment because of fears of further torture eg going back to hospital Engagement will continue to be fraught with this tension but currently was able to establish good rapport today The ongoing plan continue

30 Olanzapine depo consider dose increase indistinct arrange new GP at the interchange

So you need a new GP

35 MR NESMITH Yes but they wont take new patients right now

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL The interchange practice

MR SHORT Yes

40

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Needs to start process ofDSP I think thats disability support pension

Housing support need to explore all emergency temporary housing

45 options Centreink certificate dated until midOctober

MHIOS12 020818 P6

Diagnosis schizophrenia See scanned copy Case manager to look into psychological and other support

I suppose Centrelink likes there to be a diagnosis on their certificates

5

MS HANSON There has to be a diagnosis

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Hence that because I understand

Mr Nesmith you might disagree with that word of schizophrenia but it may be

10 what Centrelink needs to receive on the certificate to start paying you DSP

C 15

MR SHORT Its okay its a type of personality disorder its pretty close to schizophrenia anyway I just dont hear voices or dont see things that arent there

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay so its not too far from MR NESMITH Theyre both schiz

20 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL what youd accept Yes theyre both schiz

MR NESMITH Im still schizo no matter how you look at it

25 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL If you want to have a label you can have that label yes All right so thats a document we have Im going to ask a copy of that to get made for Ms Bates and Mr Nesmith just so your file is complete

30 MSBATES Thankyou

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL But theres no information in there that wasnt Ive written on that so youll have to get a copy off

35 MS HALSEY Can we have a copy of that please president

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL You havent got a copy either Ms Halsey

MS HALSEY No no

40

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Can you just get another copy printed out Make two copies one for Ms Halsey and one for Ms Bates Thank you That then updates us on the heatment plan thank you Ms Hanson Thats I think complete Is there anything else on the treatment plan Dr Drew

45

MH10812 020818 P7

SENIOR MEMBER DREW Not about the treatment plan but about the attitude towards the plan Sorry who was the psychiatrist

MS HANSON Dr Flynn

5

MS MABEY Dr Carolyn Flynn

SENIOR MEMBER DREW Right okay Is she a psychiatrist

10 MS MABEY Shes a registrar

MS HANSON Shes a registrar

SENIOR MEMBER DREW What I would have liked to know is her attitude

15 towards whether or not a PTO was needed

MS HANSON What she explained to us just before corning up to hear this is that she felt that it was needed because Mr Nesmith has a history of being itinerant and moving from state to state and has never really engaged with

20 services for a long time to try and improve or I guess make a difference with treatment

SENIOR MEMBER DREW Yes I would have thought that having a PTO would be encouraging to

25

MS HANSON Yes yes

SENIOR MEMBER DREW rather than the same I would have thought ifwe could involve him in treatment on a quasivoluntary basis so he can still

30 live where he wants to and do what he likes as long as he involves the treatment

MS HANSON I think her concern was that sorry

35 MS MABEY Hes vulnerable

MS HANSON Yes and also the fact that he was only accepting of treatment because it was the lesser of two you know the sort of two evils to avoid having to go back to hospital and so there was that period he wouldnt engage with

40 treatment

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I will ask you about that

MR NESMITH Thats not true I actually went there from the beginning on

45 my own free will

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes we pointed that out last time didnt we

5 MR NESMITH From the beginning right when I got to Canberra I made the appointments Within the first week that I was in Canberra I was in mental health

SENIOR MEMBER DREW So your position is that youll continue on this

10 treatment

MR NESMITH Of course I think its beneficial

SENIOR MEMBER DREW whether or not youre a PTO

15

MR NESMITH Yes sir I think its beneficial for me

MEMBER DAVIES That contrasts Mr Nesmith with the notes we have from Queensland in particular where you are taking yourself off oral meds and

20 theres a consistency

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I might get a copy I might give my copy of these notes to Ms Bates Its very hard to read but it does indicate that at points you were like discharged with some oral medication What happened

25 Mr Nesmith

MR NESMITH The only reason that I stopped taking my medication is because I went to the US and the medication was 600 per month there and I could not afford 600 per month for the medication I would have stayed on it

30 if it was not for that

MEMBER DAVIES So these notes do say that in 2016 that you went to the US but in front of me here Ive got a psych history that says you were treated with Risperidone in Ballarat in

35

MR NESMITH Risperidone is bad No

MEMBER DAVIES Canberra in 2013 Lismore 2014 with Olanzapine and that you didnt like those medications

40

MR NESMITH I dont like Risperidone at all

MEMBER DAVIES In fact you have there is at page 47 Im just pointing out that there is precedents here where you have stopped taking medications in

45 the past

MR NESMITH I went from Risperidone to Olanzapine

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay Where did you go to be prescribed

5 the Olanzapine Was that still in Queensland

MEMBER DAVIES It was Lismore according to

MR NESMITH It was Lismore but I also had it in Queensland too

10

MEMBER DAVIES He reports that he doesnt like our medications and they make him feel terrible

MR NESMITH Mostly in reference to the Risperidone

15

MEMBER DAVIES Doesnt believe he needs medication

MS HALSEY IfI can just jump in there please president Wendell has said to me that he would much prefer having a depo injection than having medication

20 because you know you dont have the risk of forgetting your medication and he said himself that you know on pills he was forgetting it and he would actually prefer to have depo

MS TRACEY Can I just say what he has said at the review was that he was

25 resigned to taking medication to please us and to avoid being tortured anymore

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL You dont want to be taken into hospital SENIOR MEMBER DREW My position would be Wendell that Im quite

30 convinced by reading all of this material that you do suffer from schizophrenia and that you need treatment and that you ought to be taking this treatment with a treatment order or not

MR NESMITH I agree I think I should be taking this treatment

35

SENIOR MEMBER DREW I think you should It will make your life so much better

MRNESMITH Yes

40

SENIOR MEMBER DREW It really will because otherwise you will be tortured all the time because people will just continue taking you back to hospital

45 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL You dont want that

MR NESMITH When I refer to torture Im talking Im referring to the hospital specifically Im not talking about anything outside of the hospital sir

5 SENIOR MEMBER DREW No no Its also if you dont take if you do have treatment continuing you will be much more productive than you are Really productive

MR NESMITH I agree I agree

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So I guess we now understand that the proposed treatment plan is going forward and we understand the concerns that Dr Flynn has that and weve got read through the notes that we can read

We understand that theres a history of falling out of treatment and some of

15 that is because of the medication being too expensive while he was overseas some of it is around it was actually there was times where the medication prescribed to you did not work for you as well

So for whatever reason theres been a failure to get adequate treatment or

20 engage with adequate treatment in the past I might just ask Ms BATES first Ms BATES do you have any questions for Ms Hanson about the proposed treatment engagement with treatment acceptance of treatment anything on this topic

25 MS BATES Thank you Despite the reasoning for engagement in treatment has Wendell been engaging since he was released indistinct

MS HANSON So he did come to the review yes

30 MS BATES He has presented indistinct MS HANSON Yes he did

MS BATES Just to clarify

35

MS HANSON I think that did take quite a number of like we did actually have to spend some time locating him His phone was not working was not accepting incoming calls

40 MR NESMITH You had the wrong number

MS HANSON Okay

MR NESMITH I came in

45

MH10812 020818 P11

MS HANSON Yes when we contacted

MR NESMITH It was apparently like an hour after you called

5 MS BATES Is the plan to move to indistinct

MS HANSON Well that will be dependent on whether this you know medication does work for him This is a fortnightly medication However on a higher dose it can be changed to a monthly injection yes

10

MS BATES This is a better print

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I dont need a copy

15 DR DREW You dont need a copy

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL No

MS BATES This is indistinct

20

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes This is a better printout Ms llATES than the one I gave you Its much more readable

MR NESMITH It couldnt be worse

25

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL It couldnt Ms Halsey did you have any questions for Ms Hanson on the topic of treatment plans and treatment engagement

30 MS HALSEY As youre probably aware Ive been keeping in fairly close contact with Wendell and meeting up with him and involved in the housing applications and that sort of thing Now I understand that he was allocated a case manager Nakem But Nakem is on leave currently so Ke has taken over Ke is who Wendell thought was his case manager but I understand that Ke is

35 the duty manager thats just been MS HANSON Yes standing in Yeah

MS HALSEY But the last I know that the last few days Ke hasnt been at

40 work either

MS HANSON No Ke hasnt been there either

MS HALSEY So there hasnt actually been a case manager for Wendell to

45 connect with but he has tried I mean hes been taking paperwork in that sort

MFII0S12 020818 P12

ofthing

MS HANSON Yes We did receive his housing application yesterday It

was yesterday wasnt it that you dropped it in Weve got a support officer

5 that will be actually also working with Mr Nesmith to get that lodged

MS HALSEY And the DSP that sort of thing

MS HANSON Yes I think Dr Flynn is going to do a supporting letter in

10 relation to the housing

MS HALSEY Good Im happy to do a supporting letter for the housing as well But I thought that when I was talking to Kate when I was talking to you the other day Kate that the housing application had already been done and it

15 just needed

MS HANSON It had been given

MS HALSEY the bank statements and the 100 points

20

MS HANSON Yes we I think we were waiting from my instructors on the 100 points ID which now we have So its just a matter I think of

MS HALSEY Going into housing

25

MS HANSON Yes I think as indistinct

MR NESMITH That was all into social housing We still have the regular housing to do which shes

30

MS HALSEY For ACT Housing

MR NESMITH Chris can help me with that

35 MS HALSEY So you know he has been making hes been coming into City Mental Health hes been engaging hes done his psychiatric review hes coming for his depot Quite happy to have the depot and engage in care treatment and support and I think that he is really quite committed to staying in Canberra at this stage He wants ACT Housing

40

He wants secure housing so that he can come down and stop living in his tent So I think that shows a commitment that he is not going to abscond Hes not going to be itinerant any more He actually wants to stay here and he wants to actually do his work here So I dont think theres from my point of view I

45 dont think theres any indistinct at this stage I dont think theres a case to be

made for refusing it

DR DREW Can I just ask I dont want to be rude in saying this but is the city mental the best indistinct to be involving Wendell

5

MS HANSON Yes I think we are Yes I think weve got MR NESMITH Theyre really good

10 DR DREW I know theyre very good but theyre also very stretched

MS HANSON Yes I think were working very hard to try and support him You know we dont really have a choice at this particular point in time because he is living within our catchment area anyway You know that could change

15

DR DREW I was thinking about supported accommodation

MS HANSON Well the fact that Mr Nesmith is engaging in treatment so he wouldnt actually meet their criteria But if that changed well then there is

20 that possibility and thats irrespective of where he lives in Canberra

DR DREW indistinct is that going to make any difference

MS HANSON I think the concern my understanding from Dr Flynn is this

25 sort of history of nonengagement or being itinerant and not actually continuing with treatment on a sort of a long enough basis

DR DREW Sorry I was looking at it from the opposite end

30 MS HANSON Okay

DR DREW If you want a PTO you find a youre obliged to look after it If

hes not on a PTO well he might fall off

35 MS HANSON Well thats what my understanding is Thats whats happened in the past back in 2012 when he was sort of lost to indistinct the ACT

DR DREW Yes but that might have been his fault Im concerned it might

40 be your fault

MS HANSON Well

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Would you disengage ifhe wasnt on a

45 PTO

MHl 0812 020818 P14

MS HANSON Would we disengage No No we would not

DR DREW I mean Ive hes on a PTO youve got to actively go out and see

5 him every two weeks

MS HANSON Yes we do but I you know well I believe that we do actively also you know support a lot of people who arent on PTOs We are very stretched but

10

DR DREW Im not concerned

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Can you tell me Im going to ask a procedural this is an office question You have a number of open files Some

15 of them are on people who are voluntary patients A patient stops coming to see you When do you close the file

MS HANSON There are so many different circumstances or you know situations to take into account If a person is refusing to engage with us then

20 thats completely different I mean we will do everything we possibly can based on assessments We may even look at having to get an assessment order to actually get that person to reengage We dont just we try not to just stop Theres loads of people we dont do that

25 MS MABEY We try not to do that

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Im just wondering because

MS HANSON We have an MDT process

30

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Well I want to know what the process is

MS HANSON So if somebody was having difficulty engaging with a client or getting a client to engage with us we would ask we would

35

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL A voluntary client

MS HANSON A voluntary client yes We would first of all you might seek some peer support You might discuss it with the doctor that last

40 reviewed that person You would take it to an MDT process where

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Joe failed to turn up at his review this week and I rang and left a message and hes never called me back

45 MS HANSON Yes So we will start you know looking at do we go and

MHI0S12 020818 P15

knock on that persons door Do we start contacting family Next of kin As I said we will discuss it in a multidisciplinary team meeting as to how we can engage that person You know maybe theres somebody else on the team that has worked with that person in the past and they might you know have some

5 ideas You know just continually inviting them in We dont just we tend to not just let people just drop off the books

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Then what happens So youve tried for a month and the phone calls havent been replied to and youve been up to the

10 house and theyve

DR DREW Can I just say in this case In other cases you might just let it drop

15 MS HANSON You do also sometimes have to respect a persons right to if theyre voluntary to choose to engage with

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Thats what Im interested in

20 MS HANSON We do have to respect that and we do

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So you have a patient with mental health because you think theyve got a mental illness which is being treated by medication and monitoring They cease taking the medication they cease

25 engaging in monitoring and yet sometimes it seems to me files just get closed whereas I would have thought that all of that background information if you know someone has a mental illness which leave them at risk of misadventure or neglect or whatever and they cease engaging with their treatment and with their monitoring wouldnt that mean you should apply for an assessment

30 order

MS HANSON Every case is an individual and I cant answer that question based on everybody who ceases engagement with the city mental health team You know I think we also have to take into account that people can live in the

35 community with a mental illness and they can function very well We would look at you know has this person had contact with the AFP Has there been presentations to a hospital So we take a lot of things into account but people do have the right to live with a mental illness in the community and not necessarily be harassed by us But we also are looking at risks to themselves

40 and the risk to others So theres many ways that we can do that

DR DREW I would individualise the

MS HANSON Thats what I was saying We cant say theres a blanket

45

MHl0812 020818 P16

DR DREW From the tribunal I hope with support of the other members would say that in this case if Wendell says hes going to continue treatment and he doesnt then you ought to immediately apply for an assessment order

5 MS HANSON Apply for an assessment order

DR DREW So we can compulsorily get him back into treatment

MS HANSON Yes

10

DR DREW Because he does need to stay in treatment and hes telling us hes going to

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Would you need an assessment order or

15 would you just applywith all of this information wouldnt you just apply for a psychiatric treatment order

DRDREW YoucouldapplyforaPTO

20 MS HANSON Psychiatric treatment order yes I guess the risk the only the real risk that I see in this situation is if you become it remains itinerant and doesnt go through with housing is you know also locating somebody with the sort of a history of not engaging

25 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I think that is a serious issue

MS HANSON I see that as a big issue

MS HALSEY A psychiatric treatment order doesnt make someone

30 contactable because what I see on a regular basis is applications for revocation which say the person we believe has moved interstate and is no longer a person in relation to whom a psychiatric treatment order can be made

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL We do see that is what Dr Drews point

35 I think in saying having a psychiatric treatment order sometimes can provide people with an incentive to move interstate

MS HALSEY It is possible but then

40 MS HANSON We may also you know advise you know get in contact with mental health services in that state that we think they are and let them know that they have been on a treatment order in the ACT

DR DREW Look we dont want to push

45

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL No were not trying to put Mr Nesmith away Were trying to support him in the best way possible

DR DREW Ultimately I think the best option would be for him to not have a

5 treatment order but for you to be very aware that we expect youll apply for either an assessment order a treatment order ifh doesnt turn up for treatment

MS HANSON I think we have additional risks though The risks are you cant follow up Wendell in the same way that you can follow up other people

IO because you dont know where he lives and you cant MR NESMITH Ill show you

MS HANSON The staff cant

15

MS HALSEY indistinct

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL indistinct

20 MR NESMITH indistinct MS HANSON Its not realistic

DR DREW Wendell I think all of this was showing that the treatment is

25 having an effect Because you were no way inclined to tell us last time where you were You said it was so far away noone would find it You didnt want anybody to find it

MR NESMITH There is a difference between telling you where it is and

30 showing you where it is Because if Im showing you where it is youve made a commitment to see a little bit about my life that most people wouldnt even be interested in So to me that would be meaningful if you someone from the treating team could go with me and I could just show them one time where I live that would be really awesome I would I think that would be really kind

35 ofyou

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL You could meet them at a certain you know at a fence line

40 MR NESMITH I could

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL indistinct

MR NESMITH indistinct

45

MH10812 020818 P18

DR DREW indistinct activity indistinct

MR NESMITH Its never been Mount Ainslie Ive never said Mount Ainslie

5

MS BATES I thought it was Mount Ainslie

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes actually indistinct

10 MS BATES indistinct

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Its all through the reports

MR NESMITH indistinct

15

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I think this is the risk For me Im still concerned Im concerned because were relying entirely on Wendell to contact the service and we have a long history going back to 2010 2011 where he has dropped out of treatment You dont have the same tools in your toolkit that

20 you normally have You cant drop in on him you cant put a letter under his door or a card in his letterbox Youve had problems phoning Wendell today

MS HANSON No No problems phoning him We didnt have the right number

25

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL But the onus is entirely on Wendell and that worries me

DR DREW With the PTO the same things apply Youre not going to find

30 him just because hes on a PTO

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL But then theres that overarching MS HALSEY We have an avenue of being able to advise the police that we

35 need to locate this person

MS HANSON Wendell knows he has to come in

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL My concern is why wouldnt if you had

40 concerns for a voluntary patients health and wellbeing wouldnt you also call the police and say We have this patient Theyre a voluntary patient but we havent seen them for three weeks and now weve got concerns about their wellbeing

45 MS HALSEY We do do that

MHl 0812 020818 P19

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So you dont need a PTO to call the police

5 MS HALSEY No you dont need a PTO to call the police but they are more inclined to assist us if somebody is

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL indistinct

10 MS HANSON indistinct MS HALSEY indistinct

MS HANSON I guess its because theyre resources Having a welfare check

15 done is

MS HALSEY indistinct

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Everyone has resource problems and

20 thats part of our concern here

MS HANSON Can I also just add that on the review that Mr Nesmith had with Dr Flynn the other day was where he did actually say and Im happy to provide you with a copy of this that you know Just let me be a free man

25 Why should you care what I believe in or what my inclinations are So to me that does that indicate you know that he wants to always engage with the team

MS MABEY Hes talking about his work

30

MR NESMITH Im talking about my work PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes Mr Nesmith

35 MR NESMITH The only time that Ive ever fallen out of treatment was when I moved interstate and then having to do all the reconnections because when you move interstate and youre homeless youre moving from one place youre homeless in one state and then you move to another state and youre homeless in that state you have to find all the resources The first thing you

40 need is food

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Now Mr Nesmith I have to tell you I think that you minimise the extent to which you werent proactive getting back into treatment because weve got the notes from 2011 and these are the notes

45 from I think Ballarat You reported having returned to Australia and

MH10812 020818 P20

accommodation had fallen through Youd become homeless in Melbourne where youd been homeless for two and a half week then walked to Melton obtaining a lift to Bathurst Marsh Police put you on the train to Ballarat

5 You had then you went and indistinct living in the bush and then the guesthouse So you lived in the bush on the outskirts of Ballarat for three to four weeks So that was June 2011

MS HANSON Our notes are in between 2012 and 2013 do indicate you

10 know there was a lot of difficulty getting Mr Nesmith to remain engaged with the team whilst he was here in the ACT There were a number ofreports

15

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So he was in the ACT what dates were that

MS HANSON That 2012 2013 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So he

20 MS HANSON There was a number of contacts with the AFP during that time as well

DR DREW On the other hand now hes got such a committed health team

25

MS HANSON Hell go hiking up Mount Ainslie

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Hike up there with your indistinct

30 DR DREW It is five years ago

MS HANSON It is yes

DR DREW This time Wendell has been in treatment for about what six

35 weeks Four lo six weeks Hes changed MS HANSON It wonldnt even be that long

DR DREW Well hes changed dramatically since when we saw him last

40 time

MS HANSON indistinct oral medication prior to going to indistinct is what I understand

45 DR DREW So I think hes shown significant change and improvement as a

result of treatment I think you ought to keep on the treatment MR NESMITH I will sir Thank you Dr Drew

5 DR DREW With a community health mental health team I dont care where he lives Ifhe likes Id like to live up there with him but I dont need to Ive got birds all around me evidently Im just lucky But you know but hes also talking about coming back and living in town

10 MS HALSEY Absolutely Were in close contact all the time So Im an extra level of support

MR NESMITH Chris has really helped

15 DR DREW I think we all want to work as cooperatively as possible Sorry

MS HALSEY Thats okay I dont take it personally

MS HANSON Were just really representing the psychiatrists

20

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL I guess I sort of ifI can ask a question about youve been in the sort of emergency crisis accommodation in the past and that hasnt worked

25 MR NESMITH Its dangerous Like in the Ballarat case someone actually broke into my window while I was sleeping So I caught someone in the middle of climbing into my window Im like What What are you doing

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Have you been in emergency or

30 supportive accommodation in the ACT in the past

MR NESMITH I dont want to because for example this morning I went to Havelock House and then I asked the administration if it was safe First she went like Then she went

35

DR DREW Youre kidding

MR NESMITH Then she went Im much better in the mountain than I am in a position where Im a very sensitive person I dont want people arguing I

40 mean not just arguing They yell They smash things and they scream I dont want that in my life at all

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes So

45 MR NESMITH I would be much happier in the mountain than in that

position Thats why I need to work with housing to

DR DREW But youre pursuing the option of getting your own housing

5 MR NESMITH Yes Thats what I indistinct

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL But the likelihood of that happening in a short period of time

10 MS BATES What Wendell wants its not so much that hes against emergency accommodation What he wants is accommodation where wherever he is its selfcontained Like he has his own bathroom and he has

his own cooking facilities Where he has to share bathrooms and share cooking facilities hes not keen on that because then you have this level of you know

15

MR NESMITH I need a man cave MS BATES He needs a man cave

20 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Because I saw on our notes that perhaps youd been at Samaritan House in the past and that hadnt worked out before

MS MABEY Have you been in Samaritan House

25 MR NESMITH I dont remember I dont think so

MS MABEY Im not aware of that

MR NESMITH I dont think so Like I learned in Ballarat how dangerous

30 crisis accommodation is Ever since Ballarat Ive done everything that I could to stay away from it because I know how it is

MS MABEY Which is why he lives how he lives

35 PRESIDENTMEMBERDANIEL Yes

DR DAVEY Each time he moves he falls out of treatment and he is socially isolated and we go back to square one What Im seeing here is history of him in and out of treatment and not being adequately treated

40

MR NESMITH If you help me Ill stay here

DR DAVEY Wendell thats what Im proposing to help you Im seeing that youre an intelligent capable person who could be so much better on treatment

45 who needs to stay in treatment and who needs to be in regular contact with

people in order to stay well What we have here is an undertreated history where you have been itinerant and you have fallen out of treatment I actually think you should be on an order because I want to see you being happy and healthy for a while

5

I dont care whether you live in a tent either I dont think its the best place for you to live I think youre too young and capable to be socially isolated but you need to be where people can look after you where you can make friends What about your issues about finding a wife Youve been talking about

10 finding a wife

MR NESMITH Im still doing it but I want to do it through the Internet I think thats actually really good because paving a new way for people to meet each other By my putting my heart out on the Internet for the entire world to

15 see eventually Ill get led to that person that like Im famous In the US Im really popular The thing is that will eventually lead to someone who wants what I have to offer So I think in the future its going to happen a lot more often because you can match really really good people together if you just use the Internet to see yourself

20

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Thats not a new concept

MR NESMITH Its not a dating site Its not a dating site Its standing in front of a camera holding the camera pointing back at you and talking to that

25 camera about your life and how you feel about everything and what is meaningful to you and what you hate about the world and what you love about the world Thats how I want to meet my wife Im willing to wait Thats okay Im a very patient person In philosophy weve got we learn patients very well

30

MS BATES May I address the tribunal

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Yes Were just exploring things

35 MS BATES Yes I can see I think the discussion has been incredibly helpful indistinct Member Davey I can see your concerns and its your concerns Id like to address primarily Its coming down to what kind of treatment would he get on a PTO versus what kind of treatment would he get indistinct

40 DR DAVEY Thats not what concerns me

MS BATES Oh

DR DAVEY I dont think hes going to accept treatment

45

MHl0812 020818 P24

MS BATES Ill come back to your concerns

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Deal with Dr Daveys concerns then come back to mine

5

MS BATES Arguably there really isnt a indistinct in this case Your concern is about the long term and whether or not hell continue to engage and in particular the treatment team being able to engage with him Being able to indistinct if something goes wrong I cant see how a PTO being in place

10 would change any of that and so arguably its not the least restrictive option in this case

The least restrictive option is there not being a psychiatric treatment order and to engage voluntarily I do recognise your concerns but I think in some

15 situations it might be the case that PTO would provide something that not being on a PTO wouldnt provide I cant see how thats the case in this situation

DR DAVEY I can I can see that Wendell knows that he has to attend for

20 treatment and the onus is on him and to come down from the mountain to attend as opposed to people finding him in an undisclosed location I think the other option there is with a PTO ifhe does ifwe do lose him then we can at least call the police as well So I think my concern is that this is very one sided Its putting the treating team in a very difficult position and I want

25 Wendell to have some sort of obligation to come down the mountain

MS MABEY He does that every day Dr Davey

DR DAVEY Into treatment He does while he is under this

30

MS MABEY No he does it every day He has to To get water to get gas for his heater He comes every day Ive been in touch with him every day and he has the same routine every day

35 MR NESMITH indistinct

DR DAVEY indistinct I think thats right for food and for social contact but in order to receive treatment hes very clever Hes done this for the last seven or eight or more years He knows that until weve made this decision

40 that he has to toe the line The history tells me that he hasnt toed the line once hes gone off the treatment order Thats my concern I want him to be well and I want him to function adequately and healthily and happily Up until now he hasnt Thats what you have to convince me about

45 MS BATES While he has had this process hanging over his head arguably

MH10812 020818 P25

like Dr Drew mentioned earlier indistinct he hasnt been under any kind of order since he was released indistinct he has expressed not only verbally but through his actions a willingness to engage He has come down hes been given depot injections which are

5

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL One in hospital and one since discharge

MS BATES Which are invasive Lets not indistinct you know nobody else has to go through that He has expressed his willingness todo that and to

IO continue to do that I note youre looking at the history and that look I cant argue against that There is history thats problematic but on this occasion and this is what we need to be primarily looking at I understand that you need to also look at the history to determine whether or not somebody is going indistinct but primarily in this case he has shown a willingness and expressed

15 a willingness to consent to continue this treatment

I think it would be a far more therapeutic process for him to be engaged voluntarily on this occasion Its also I mean the tribunal has said this before This is your last chance you know This is like Weve given you chances

20 before You cant just keep doing this Eventually youre going to be on a psychiatric treatment order I think given the history the length oftime hes been engaged with I think the previous presentation in the ACT was 2013 Yes

25 I think given that time in between noting that there has been extreme indistinct I think its worthwhile giving him another chance From a legal point of view I really I would argue the indistinct can be fully demonstrated in this case I think which is the key question here But also I think there is a less restrictive option available and I think indistinct in this case

30

DRDAVEY Ifitworks MS BATES Yes

35 DR DAVEY Theres a I 0year history of it not working

MS MABEY Can I ask a question

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL We might adjourn and discuss it unless

40 anyone wants to make any further comments

DR DREW Can I say one other thing Can I suggest that very quickly someone from the treatment team goes with Wendell up to see where he does live and then when you call the police youll know where to send them

45

MHI0S12 020818 P26

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Thats a good idea MS HALSEY I put my hand up for that

5 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL On a sunny day Not a rainy day Does anyone have any other submissions theyd like to make before we adjourn to consider

MS MABEY I just wanted to ask a question because I Im not I didnt read

10 all of the notes but when he was under a treatment order in Queensland PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL On what occasion

MS MABEY I believe it was 2016

15

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL 2016 yes MS MABEY Yes Did he

20 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL It was revoked on 16 June because he said hed take treatment He was discharged on Olanzapine on 7 July 2016 and thats where the records stop

MS MABEY Did you continue treatment after the treatment order

25

MR NESMITH I did yes I actually already told you about this When I went to the US and it was 600 per month I cannot afford that

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Then he came back to

30

MS MABEY How long did you go to the states for

MR NESMITH I was there for six months then I went to Mexico for one year and then I came from Mexico to here

35

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL To Canberra

DR DAVEY Which is when you presented to City Mental Health

40 MR NESMITH Ive been here for four months almost

MS MABEY And theres been concerns about his mental state for that time PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Okay Ms Bates do you want to say

45 something before were adjourned

MH10812 020818 P27

MS BATES In regards to police even if if somebody is on a PTO I understand having that piece of paper is helpful but you can indistinct issues We believe there is a risk and

5

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Well there has already been contact with the AFP obviously because thats how he was taken to the hospital because of concerns with his behaviour at Centrelink

10 MS BATES So while we can never predict how the police will react in any given situation noting that there has been indistinct incident they would arguably take this one seriously regardless of whether a PTO is in place I think that the police would take it seriously Thank you

15 PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Ms Halsey I think we understand your position that we shouldnt make an order

ADJOURNED

20 RESUMED

423 pm

431 pm

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL So were resuming matter MH108 of 2012

25 DR DREW Can I say Im going to excuse myself I have another appointment I have to go to but Ive made my position plain to everybody before

MR NESMITH Thank you Dr Drew

30

PRESIDENT MEMBER DANIEL Look obviously this is a very difficult decision and in fact the tribunal is not in agreement about it Dr Drew has made his view clear and that he does not think that its appropriate to make the psychiatric treatment order and certainly the most therapeutic situation

35 would be voluntary treatment I can say the tribunal is in agreement in these respects We do think that Mr Nesmith has a mental illness

We do think that without treatment he is likely to do harm to himself serious harm as a result of misadventure or selfneglect and potentially how people

40 may react to him that leads him to risk and that also without treatment his mental state and functioning will seriously deteriorate So were satisfied of those things What the areas of disagreement focus on are the question of whether Mr Nesmith refuses treatment or not I know weve had a lot of conversation about what practical effect a PTO would have In my view thats

45 not particularly relevant Legally it might be relevant in practical terms but its

MHI 0812 020818 P28

not part of the legal test The legal test is actually does he have a mental illness whats the risk if not treated and then this key question is he refusing treatment

5 Both Dr Davies and I are of the view that there should be a treatment order for six months and the reason why is because when we look at those medical records we see a history of a person who continually says to the authorities that he will accept treatment and then it all goes wrong and hes not involved in treatment any more So just for the purposes of remembering that the best

10 predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour the records that we have say that he came selfpresented to a hospital in June 2011 and this was in Ballarat with suicidal ideation At that stage he had not eaten for six days He was quite unwell and he was admitted to hospital

15 The latest record from that 2011 episode was 31 August 2011 when it wrote that two weeks postdischarge he was to move to Western Australia he was referred to the WA Mental Health Service Swan Mental Health He was going to be living with a supportive bunch of friends and everything was going to be wonderful but it didnt work out that way There was no order made because it

20 was all going to be voluntary It didnt work out because we see that in April 2012 actually hes admitted to the ACT Adult Mental Health Unit then hes discharged again voluntary lost to that service

The next thing that happens is he has another admission in Canberra in 2013

25 where he came in as we discussed previously through the Emergency Department Again an opportunity for him to engage voluntarily in treatment for what were satisfied is his mental illness lost to followup treatment Then he ends up in Lismore in 2014 We dont have the records for that but we do have a reference that he says that he spent a week in prison in Grafton I dont

30 know whether thats a reference to being kept in hospital or actually a criminal thing we dont know But whatever we know is he didnt stay in treatment after coming in to treatment in Lismore he was out of it

By 12 April 2016 he is in Queensland He gets admitted after what sounds like

35 a very risky episode at a caravan park where hes making comments about young women and that could have led him to being misunderstood and physically threatened Certainly he was brought in under an emergency order to the hospital He was put on an involuntary treatment order That was revoked on 16 June He was discharged on Olanzapine on 7 July 2016 but

40 thats where the records end because hes been lost to treatment

We are satisfied on the basis of that record that no matter what Mr Nesmith says and how persuasive he is and genuine Mr Nesmith I think youre genuine and so does Dr Davies when you tell us youre going to engage in

45 treatment Its not that we think youre lying to us we think youre absolutely

MHl 0812 020818 P29

honest and genuine but life interferes with that But were confident that with a psychiatric treatment order because you are a good person and a

ruleconscious person you will comply with that and you wont be lost to treatment while that order is in place

5

So were going to make an order for six months and well review that before it expires and we look forward to hearing what your accommodation turns out being like when we review this It might be that youre still living where youre living now because you might choose to do that and thats fine or you might

IO choose to go into other accommodation Thats fine too But whats really important is were ordering that you will continue with the recommended medical treatment for another six months and well hear how thats going at the end of those six months Okay

Mr Nesmith Is a 33 yo homeless unemployed gentleman who was referred to our service by his GP on the 15518 and seen my our mental health cllnlclans on several occasions before his psychiatry assessment on 6th June 2018

Mr Nesmlths Initial presentation wascharacterized by quite odd and eccentric beliefs and preoccupations and grandiose themes These manifested more floridly on the lt June 2018 with concerns he had an untreated psychosis with manlcfeatures and an appointment made with Dr Flynn registrar Mr Nesmith consistently Insists that he does not believe he has a mental Illness nor needing any antipsychotlc or other psychiatric medications our concerns are for his longterm welfare If he remains chronically unwell and associated risks discussed In more detail In sections to follow

Illness characterized by an elaborate systemlzed delusional system that Is very fixed and possibly on a background of a schzotypal personality disorder with longstanding beliefs and suspicion about several organizations Infiltrating the government social and medical services including the Illuminati Freemasons and Artificial Intelligence Al

Mr Nesmith seems to spend most of his time gathering evidence of the Freemasons activity In Canberra a place he believes Is the Occult Capital of the World He believes the Freemasons do ritualistic and brutal child sacrifices and states he has evidence of this He also spends time recording short films an his phone as part of his evidence and distribution to others to warn them of these organisations Infiltrating society and showing proof for example of Al taking control He also spends time writing emails to various organisations eg AFP to alert thetn of the atrocities of the Freemasons and pleading they take action He presents very earnest and driven to save society from these malevolent organisations and sees himself as a type of saviour He emails and videos he shows us are more dlfflcultto follow and convey a deeper level of disorganization In his thinking

Mr Nesmith states he has been a student of Philosophy for 10 years recently finishing a degree at Murdoch University It does not seem his was worked though he states he Is a successful FilmMaker and has won several awards In Film Festivals overseas It is unclear If Mt Nesmith could hold down any form of employment with the level of his preoccupations and role he has defined for himself In society He also chooses to Isolate himself by camping In Mt Ainslie bush area as a way to avoid the malevolent people he believes Inhabit the city though he has voiced openness to assistancewith more stable housing

Mt Nesmith presents with Impeccable manners often very polltebut can become more irritable If hefeels we are not believing his convictions or discuss 111ental health Illness and treatment At times hehas presented with more racing speech elevated and expansive mood and harder to follow In conversations See details In assessroeat0AtRfuIAlJ0wf0

Recently seen by AATworkers and has presented very grandiose manic Today

Wendell presented today with very elaborate delusions with themes that the world needs saving from the

Apocalypse from vacous malevolent organisations and Al and that It was his duty to warn and save others and the world at large There was a lot of grandiosity as weI Jdentfes hlmsef as a saviour

He was very preoccupied driven around his belefs and becameirritable If we hypothesized alternatives or seem to doubt him He showed no Insight Into potentally having a mental Illness insisting that I am not crazy there Is no way I will go on any antpsychotic andthat we have th_e problems f We dont believe him and that we would be part of the coverup and sensorng that has lnfltrated all levels of government police and health services

Did say he getselevated because he Is passionate and people think this Is a mental 11Mss but challenged societal norms and upset he hasbeen labelled In past as being unwell

Whilst Wendell 1ked to be vey polite and call me mam could smile and be gracious rapport was brittle when he felt under scrutiny challengednot belleved But he contained the rrtab1ty displaying It In more driven proof speech wanting to show evidence on his phone

Tolerated redirection and Interruptions Content of his Interview Included

Described himself asa Philosopher who Integrates mythology eg showing that Peter Pan Is real sociology and other cultural subject to explain the truth about society

Called himself an Award winning fllmmaker with a recent prize at the Socia Uprising Grassroot and Resistance fllm festval in the US Fm was a private reease to avoid censorship called Ivory Heart

He belleves Canberra ls the occult capital of the World

He thinks the Freemasons are a satanic cult that sacrifice children and thathe Grandmaster Is In Canberra He

Is Investgating them documenting them and has proof to show others eg poIce of their crimes and he wants to take aver the Freemasons to save everyone from them

There ls no person he has specifically Identified st looking but states he has all the evidence

He described abizzare belef In a ritual that the Freemasons do icudlligsucking the blood from an artery to use the effects of substances from the adrenal gland for powerhealth

He beeves that Artificial lnte1gence Al lstaking aver the world That Al has integrated Into all our technology and creating synthetic bodies to appear as humans

Wendalshowedusavideopartofwentfor45mins wewatchedabout5mnshecreatedonhlslphone titled War games as proof of this

It was an amateur footage of trees anda Canberra building with a voice over that didnt make much sense but then footage of another phone with a Srtype animation lady answering his questions about the Freemasons Answered seemed autogenerated from a srllce assistant program but Wendall was adamant this was an example of Als capabllites and manevalent Intent

Wendall believes he Is now the head of the 1umlnati who use to be an organisation Intent on taking aver the world as welt but he ftopped this Hence his focus nowon the Freemasons and Al

Wendall also read a long email he sent to to the AFP yesterday detailing his beJefsthat the Freemasons have Infiltrated them and his proof of the Freemasons evil and that they should act etc Although the sentence structure was logical his Ideas were difficult to falaw at times Included a reference to a pineal gland

t addiction and mentioning atrocities without defining them

Also described on a mission looking far his wife that he reference some attachment spiritually at birth and It Is his questtaflnd her Tattoo an chest was a name he has given her but yet ta find her real name Also showed various tattoos that had rellgous or other speca significance In his various quests

I tried to explore with Wendel ciny past psychiatric treatmentexperiences

He states he hasbeen Imprisoned In Canberra Grafton and 12 other psychiatric hospitals In Australa He beleves this was due ta trying to censor him Adamant he has never had mental health problems

He hashad oanzapne In the past and found It awful very sedatingflattening and felt ft was done with malevolent Intent

He states risperldone was even worse but didnt give specifcs as started to get Irritable about me watching to push medications an him

Wont consider anything new eg Abllify as does notbelieve he needs It and thinks we are pushing medication to censor him or for some other ill Intent or for our benefitgain

only medication he would accept isXanax for when he felt he need to restslow down Explained rarely

prescribed now and why Seemed to accept this and did not push for script

DA

Wendell denies any ict drug use eg cannabis Jee ecstacy synthetics

However he states hebuys herbsfrom the chemist and smokes those sometimes NII acoho

Nicotine stains noted on fingers

Medical

nil medical history of note disclosed states he Isvery healthy flt and strong nll physical complaintsconcerns

Agrees he hasnt had blood tests for a Jong time and agreeable to have some done

Agreeable to finding a GP

Family

WendeI wasnt keen to talk about this family He states his parents are In USA

He has not contacted them for years as they do notbelieve In what he is doing

Same with his one blologca brother Ricky

Also states his parents adopted 2731 children around the world

Friends

states he has a few close friends but did not want to elaborate

Risk

Wendell is Intent on finding the Freemasons and confronting people If he suspects that are them or to tel them his views about needing to be warnedsaved He agreed some people wont listen to him but that he had to try There was no single person he had Identified yet in hisevidence I dont know yet I am stlll

looking

He would like to challenge the grandmaster In hand to hand combat but no way would I klIhurt him I am a pacifist IJust want to be the new leader of the Freemasons Ike I did with the 1lumlnati His proof of leadership of the 1luminati was not from a combat challenge but an email he sent to a princess which he showed usand dldnt make much sense and I noted emall address had rebounded as undelivered

He denes any thought or Intent to hurt someone even if he felt for example they had sacrificed children

He denied any problems with poIce and has never been aggressivethreatened people He was upset that I asked about this as It went against his ethicsmorals

Wendells biggest current risk Is potentially aggravating others with his driven beJefs and conflict arising Misadventure from his homelessness and living in a tent in a harsh approaching winter could be a problem

There ls also the past risk Incident when he Inserted a speaker wire Into his penis 2013 and the possbty of further Incidents if based on a delusional belief

Chronic risks for Wendell is a poor prognosis and recovery the longer a psychotic Illness is left untreated that any medca contributors to his psychosis have yet to be Investigated and that he likely to stay unemployed Itinerant and on the fringe

It Is unknown If he would ever act violently based on his deusans There is not enough past known history try and quanttate risk other than his psychotic Illness Js a risk factor

Excerpt for mental health nurse assessment note Jarlna Bova 1st June 2018

Wendell was much mare elevated and grandiose this morning He stated he had not slept last night had very 1ttefood breath smelt slightly of acetone and was feeIng fantastic and was loving the world He was animated and demonstrative when showing author the actions of an Incident he stated he had been Involved In earlier In the week

Speech rapid rate expressive tone normal volume Dffcultto keep up with his conversation due to Wendell Jumping from topc to topic Difficult for author to respond during Interacton due tothe pressure of speech Affect Elevated grandiose appears to be decompensating with mental health Congruent with stated mood Thought Content

No Insight Into having a mental illness rather that it Is other people who are unwell If they dont believe his proof evidence etc WIii not trial any medlcotion as he belleves he Is well and that any medication for his mental health is medical doctors tryingto censor him or forsome other ill intent or for our benefitgain

Relevant Past History

Mr Nesmith has only had two prior contact periods with our Service

The first was In April 2012 referred by GP resulting In a short involuntary PSU acute adult psychiatric ward admission Canberra Hospital

The referral from GP stated Ile presented to me with some magca thinkingno auditory hallucinations he has no friends and claimed to be living on the mountain There Is a family history of schizoid personality disorder I believe he has schzotypa personality disorder

He was seen by CATT clinicians with Mr Nesmith agreeable to coming to hospital for an assessment but he had

told CATT that our system wfll not help that this is the 2 in a psychiatric ward your doctors will diagnose me as either schizophrenia or schzotypa they will force medication on me and push their own Ideal of what a bWiRAAtt0rs1JnrucbsurIJiJM11LbernpreGBwr11JthM0dribG0t1dftiGGSthathwu_gJtabe11tJJlhCJ 1nP1wilkb

me your systems do not help BUT no longer care about anything so thefoliles of your society wlil have to deal with its creation ME OR I end my life Your choice I no longer care

Mr Nesmith was assessed by a psychiatrist Dr J cubis who thought he had a likely psychotic illness or schlzotypal personality disorder Mr Nesmith was admitted to PSU acute adult mental health unit on 28th April 5th May 2012 Mr Nesmith did not talk or cooperate much with the admission and as he was not floridly psychotic the team could not uphold a PTO so he was discharged and lost contact with services

The second contact was brief in 2013 by the psychiatry cL Canberra HospItal team after a bizarre Incident where he had inserted speaker wire Into his penis requiring surgical Intervention Surgical team referred to psychiatry CL as his speech was hard to follow he had odd behavioursbeliefs and seemed quite paranoid He was lnltlally placed on an ED7 as presented psychotic with thought disorder and grandiose But this was taken off a few days later as he presented more settled with no evidence of psychosis though his odd and eccentric personality paranoid themes and alternate lifestyle camping In busliland near Mt Ainslie to avoid

people was noted at the time He was hence discharged and not seen again hY our services until this year

When asked about this hospital Incident r cently Mr Nesmith talked about being embarrassed It had happened and that It was sexual experimentation that went horribly wrong as he wanting to try and Increase sexual stimulation

In regards to other psychiatric presentations Mr Nesmith has spoken about being locked up In hospitals in various places In NSW at least on 2 occasions With him believing he was being censored for his beliefs and part of a greater conspiracy and coverup He was reluctant to give details of his time In hospital or precise locations He could 11st by name several antlpsychotlcs used olanzapine risperidone quetlaplne and the awful side effects experienced adding to his negative experience It does not seem he has ever taken anlpsychotlcs longterm only In restrictive environments

There Is no known history of his earlier years In the US before he moved to Australia He states he Is estranged from his us parents and siblings because they 11dont believe In my cause He Is adamant he does not want contact with them We have not found any longerterm friend or contact for any collateral history alas

their own views of societal norms and llness In a biased way and with IllIntent Any discussion of mental Illness or offer of antlpsychotlc medication Is seen as us being Judgemental dismissive and at worse part of the c nsplracy to keep him from doing hls tasks of saving humanity from various threats He has a hint of Insight than he can get busy and elevated but only wants Xanax alprazolam to help slow him down He believes this Is part of his excitable personality style and not a sign of a mood or psychotic disorder The notion ofgong to hospital for treatment Is also seen as the ultimate punishment alas and he would find this very traumatic and coercive and further proof of the medical establishments malevolence This belief ls also based on real past negative experiences with Involuntary psychiatric admissions and side effects from several antipsychotics that he reports

REFUSAL

6 Does the person refuse to receive treatment care or support or If the person has decisionmaking capacity refuse to consent to treatment care or support

IBlYos D No If yes describe what the person does andor says that constitutes refusal

Mr Nesmith s refusing to trial any antlpsychotc medication due to his conviction that he does not have a mental Illness and that any treatment will be unjust unfounded and cause harm

Illness or mental disorder IBJYes No

Is the person suffering or likely to suffer serious mental or physical deterioration because of the mental Illness or mental disorder IBJYes No

Jfyes explain your reasons for this opinion

Risk prediction is a fraught area as clinicians cannot be precise or quantltate risk given the variables and unpredictable nature of peoples behaviour and their environments

However the risks to Mr Nesmith Include that the longer he Is left with an untreated psychotic Illness the worse his prognosis and quality of recovery that could have devastating Impacts on his ability to work have relationships Jive and function In society There Is a potential risk of him falsely Identifying a community member as the grandmaster of the Freemasons based on a delusion and conflict arising with possible violent sequelae although there Is no past history of violent altercations yet that we know of His lntlnerant and secretlv lifestyle limits any corroborative history He may be at risk of angering others with his investigations and misadventure There are risks around camping In the bush regions If he was to have physical health issues or not have enough gear for w rmth Personal safety and security Is also problematic

Is is not known if Mr Nesmith would selfharm If he became overwhelmed by his predicament and fate of the world There was the past lncldeht of Inserting a wire Into his penis which may have been due

TREATMENT

8 What treatment care or support Is proposed If a treatment plan is prepared it may be attached to this form

It Is unlikely given his lack of Insight that Mr Nesmith would agree to trial an oral antlpsychotlc In the community and be adherent Hence a treatment trial would Involve a hospital environment with the goals of starting an oral antlpsychotlc eg pallperldone or arlplprazole and switching to a depot preparation Several weeks would be required and the Inpatient setting choices Include the Acute Adult Mental Health Unit at Canberra Hospital or possibly a rehabilitat1on facility that may be less stressful for him

Created By Dr Caroline Flynn Registrar Printed By Dr Caroline Flynn Registrar

Page 10 of 14

Community followup would Include regular contact with a casemanager and doctor psychological therapy If desired and assistance linking to services for housing and other goals he may have In his recovery eg further study or work

9 Why or how will treatment care or support be likely to reduce harm or deterioration or result in an Improvement to the persons condltloni

It Is hoped thut Mr Nesmlths delusional preoccupations are reversible and that with treatment he would be able to not be so consumed In saving the world collect evidence confronting organisations etc and transfer his Intellect and creativity to other pursuits that hopefully provide Joy fulfillment and security and not place him at risk The risks associated with chronic mental Illness would hopefully be reduced and his quality of life Improved There Is a possibility that he Is estranged from his US family

due to delusional beliefs and this could potentially be healed and Increase his supports

10 WhY cant the treatment care or support f5e adequafoly prov1aedWlcfflilss r sMdlo11 al Elie leed6111

ofch lce nd movement oTth persri

Primarily because Mr Nesmith wlll not consent to treatment in the community setting and Is likely to disengage from our services entirely If he feels we are a threat to his liberty Any reasonable treatment trial wilt Involve at least 48 weeks of adequate dose medication

torture ie going back to hospital Im sure the CM will attend the hearing and provide the Tribunal with further information as requested

Impression after psychiatric review on 31718

Remains very fixed around his beliefs but seems less driven then prior to hospitalization Very grandiose

No insight that he has a psychotic illness

Ongoing plan

Continue olanzapine depot Consider dose increase

Need to arrange new GP Interchange Needs to start process of DSP Housing support need to explore all emergencytemporary housing options

Centrelink Certificate dated until midoctober diagnosis schizophrenia see scanned copy Case manager to look into psychological and other support

The basis of Mr Nesmith1s appeal is that the Tribunal erred 1nits decision to grant the PTO as there wns insufficient evidence to satisfy all

of the elements under section 58 of the Mental Health Act 2015

Specifically section 582bii as there was no evidence to suggest that Mr Nesmith was refusing treabnent and the evidence befote the Ttibunal_confirmed that Mr Nesmith had been compliant with the directions of the treating team

Fu1ther there was insufficient evidence to satisfy section 582c i and ii as there was no evidence to show thatMr Nesmith was a serious 1isk to himself or others1 or that he was at11sk of detedmation

Reasons why the appeal should proceed

The Appellant kindly requests that in the interest of justice the Tribunal grant an extension to the 28 dayperiod Mr Nesmith was granted legal assistance on 30 August 2019 allowing him to rnceivelegal advice and representation duringthe appeal process Jnstmctions were obtained after the appeal period expired and this BJlpeal has been filed pro11ptly thereafter

T1e appeal should procee4 on thel sis that there was an error in judgement a11l that the Appellant has strong grnunds for an appeal

In respect of WENDELL CHARLES NESMITH

DOB 27061984

Tribunal Presidential Member MT Daniel Senior Member L Drew

Member R Davies

Pate of Order 2 August 2018

PSYCHIATRIC TREATMENT ORDER

The Tribunal Orders

1 The Tribunal makes a Psychiatric Treatment Orde_r in relation to Wendell Charles Nesmith

2 Wendell Charles Nesmith must comply With any determination made by the Chief Psychiatrist or delegate under section 62 of the Mental Health Act 2015

3 Unless sooner revoked this order has effect for 6 months

The Tribunal notes

a This order will be reviewed on its own motion prior to expiry

STATEMENT

i This statement sets out how Wendell Charles Nesmith meets the criteria for a psychiatric treatment order under section 582 of the Mental Health Act 2015

The findings in the siatemeht are based on the information before the Tribunal

and are made on the balance of probabilities

c1 f117J

l

iii

Wendell Charles Nesmith has a mental illness because he has dcmditJth that

se_riou ly impairs either temporarily Cl pemanently Is menalf4ii Xifn_m1 areas including thought and mood which 1s characterised by ae Flf_lJ Ji J f _

symptoms including delusions and serious disturbance of mood

iii Wendell Charles Nesmith does not have decisionmaking capaci fll P11fl the treatment care or support because he cannot understand whena derns1on about his treatment care or support needs to be made the decision he cannot weigh up the consequences of th main choices he cannot understand how the consEqUEnces ciffect him and he cannot make the decision on the basis of the matters set out above

iv Wendell Charles Nesmith refuses the treatment determined in relation to himself because although he says he will accept treatment and in the very recent past has been accepting treatment he has a 7 year history of ceasing treatment after advising health authorities he will continue with trec1tment The Tribunal considers his current compliance with treatment is of a short duration and against the extensive history is of the view that he refuses treatment

v The Tribunal believes on reasonable grounds that because of his mental illness Wendell Charles Nesmith is likely to do serious harm to himself as a result of misadventure or self neglect when unwell

vi The Tribunal believes on reasonable grounds that because of his mental fllness Wendell Charles Nesmith is likely to suffer serious deterioration of his mental state and functioning if untreated

vii

C

The Tribunal is satisfied that psychiatric treatment care or supiort is likely to reduce the likelihood of harm or deterioration mentioned above and is likely to result in an improvement in Wendell Charles Nesmiths psychiatric condition

7 In an appeal by way ofreview under s 82b of the ACAT Act

the Appellant must demonstrate an eTor of fact or law or an erroneous exercise of discretion and

the Appeal Tribunal may receive futther evidence1

8 The Respondent submits that the factors relevant to determining whether to admit further evidence in an appeal by way ofreview include

a Whether exceptional circumstances exist that wairnnt the admission offu1ther evidence in light of the need for finality in litigation2 The exceptional circutnstances test was stated by the High Court in Fox v Percy 2003 214 CLR 118 at 22 in respect of appeals to the NSW Supreme Coutt It has been adopted in respect of appeals within ACAT in appellate decisions of the Tribunal and the ACT Supreme Court3

b Whether the further evidence is relevant to the grout1ds of appeal in that it will assist the Appeal Tribunal to decide whether there was any eToi in the decision under review4 This may include considering

i whether the evidence relates to facts that existed at the time the decision under appeal was made as evidence that goes to facts that postdate the decision is less likely to be relevant to whether there was any e1Tor in the decision5 and

ii whether the evidence is in the nature of an expert opinion on relevant issues6 a11d

c Whether the paity seeking leave to present the futther evidence had the oppottunity to present that evidence at the hearing at first instance or put another way whether there was any breach of procedural fairness to the patty at

first instance7 and

d Whether the admission of the fu1ther evidence would require even futther evidence still to properly assess the weight to be afforded to it for example

ACT Chief Psychiatrist

Respondent

RESPONDENTS SUBMISSIONS

1 The ACT Chief Psychiatrist Respondent seeks orders that the appeal be dismissed and the Tribunals decision of2 August 2018 be confirmed

Background

2 On 2 August 2018 the Tribunal the Original Tribunal made a Psychiatric Treatment Order PTO in relation to the Appellant for a period of 6 months following hearings on 12 July 2018 and 2 August 20181

3 The Tribunals power to make a PTO is set out ins 58 of the Mental Health Act 2015

Mental Health Act as follows

58 Psychiatric treatment order

I This section applies to

a a person assessed under an assessment order or

b a person in relation to whom an application for a mental health order has been made

under part 52 or

c a person in relation to whom an application for a forensic mental health order has been made under division 712 or

d a person required by a court to submit to the jurisdiction of the ACAT nuder the Crimes Act part 13 or the Crimes Act 1914 Cwlth patt IB

2 The ACAT may make a psychiatric treatment order in relation to the person if

a the person has a mental illness and

b eithe1

i the person does not have decisionmaking capacity to consent to the treatment care or

support and refuses to receive the heatment care or support or

ii the person has decisionmaking capacity to consent to the treatment care or support

but refuses to consent and

c the ACAT believes on reasonable grounds that because of the mental illness the

person

i is doing or is likely to do serious harm to themself or someone else or

ii is suffering or is likely to suffer serious mental or physical deterioration and

1 The Application for a PTO in respect of the Appellant MH 1082012 first came before the Tribunal prior to 12 July 20 I8 but was adjourned to that date so the Appellant could be present Transcript 12 July 2018

pp 34

d in relation to a person mentioned in paragraph b iithe ACAT is satisfied that the harm or deterioration or likely harm or deterioration mentioned in paragraph c is of such a serious nature that it outweighs the persons right to refuse to consent and

e the ACAT is satisfied that psychiatric treatment care or support is likelyto

i reduce the harm or deterioration or the likelihood of the harm or deterioration mentioned in paragraph c or

ii result in an improvement in the persons psychiatric condition and

f if an application has been made for a forensic mental health orderthe ACAT is satisfied that a psychiatric treatment order should be made instead and

g the ACAT is satisfied that the treatment care or supp01t to be provided under the psychiatric treatment order cannot be adequately provided in another way that would involve less restriction of the freedom of choice and movement of the person

4 The Appellant is a person in respect of whom a PTO may be made under s 581b The findings of the Original Tribunal as set out in its Statement dated 2 August 2018 match closely the te1ms of s 582 of the Mental Health Act In particular the Original Tribunal found that

the Appellant has a mental illness

the Appellant does not have decisionmalcing capacity to consent to the treatment care or support proposed for him

the Appellant refused the treatment proposed for him

because although he says he will accept treatment and in the very recent past has been accepting treatment he has a 7 year history of ceasing treatment after advising health authorities he will continue with treatment The Tribunal considers his cunent compliance with treatment is of a short duration and against the extensive history is of the view that he refuses treatment Statement aiv

there are reasonable grounds to believe that the Appellant because of his mental illness

o is likely to do serious haim to himself as a result of misadventure or selfneglect when unwell and

o is likely to suffer serious deterioration of his mental state and functioning if untreated

psychiatric treatment care or support is likely to reduce the likelihood ofhaim or deterioration and is likely to result in an improvement of the Appellants psychiatric condition and

the treatment proposed under the PTO could not be adequately provided in another way that would involve less restriction of the Appellants freedom of choice and movement

5 The Original Tribunals decision was made by majority The Psychiatrist Member was of the view that a PTO should not be made

6 The documentary evidence before the Original Tribunal comprised

the application for a PTO by Dr Emma Glanville Consultant Psychiatrist as delegate or nominee of the Chief Psychiatrist dated 19 June 2018 and

records obtained from the Chief Psychiatrist from mental health services in Victoria Ballarat and QLD Caims in respect of the Appellants prior admissions in those jurisdictions

7 The Tribunal heard evidence from the following persons who attended the hearings on 12 July andor 2 August 2018

the Appellant

Dr Reagan ONeil and Mr Kel Thomas from the Adult Mental Health Unit at The Canbe1Ta Hospital TCH

Ms Julie Hanson and Ms Kate Mabey from City Mental Health and

Ms Chris Halsey from the Public Advocate

medications19 Accordingly on 19 June 2018 an application for a PTO was made on behalf of the Chief Psychiatrist

17 On 4 July 2018 the Appellant was admitted to the Adult Mental Health Unit at TCH under an emergency assessment order after displaying highly agitated and aggressive behaviours towards staff at a Centrelinlc office which had resulted in police being called20 On his admission he was agitated aggressive manic and highly labile and he had intense very wellsystemised delusional beliefs21 He initially Iefused medication but was given intramuscular antipsychotics and subsequently agreed to talce an injection of Olanzapine His presentation was much improved by the first hearing before the Original Tribunal on 12 July 201822 On 17 July 2018 the Appellant was discharged from TCH

18 On 2 August 2018 the Original Tribunal made the PTO

19 On 7 September 2018 the Appellant filed an Application for Appeal together with an application to extend the time for lodging an appeal which was granted by consent

20 The Appellant has not filed any further documents in support of his appeal although he has indicated he wishes to tender new evidence see below

Appellants grounds of appeal

21 The Appellants grounds of appeal state that the Original Tribunal erred in making the PTO because there was insufficient evidence or no evidence before the Original Tribunal to satisfy the following requirements of s 582 of the Mental Health Act

that the Appellant was refusing treatment s 582biiGround 1 andor

that the Appellant was a serious risk to himself or others or that he was at risk of deterioration s 582ci and iiGround 2

Respondents submissions on admission of new evidence

22 The Respondent does not seek to rely on new evidence at the appeal hearing

23 The Appellant indicated by emails dated 25 and 26 October 2018 to the Tribunal that he wishes to submit his website nesmithnet in particular the section on Rebirthing into evidence on appeal

24 The Respondent reiterates its submission of2 November 2018 that new evidence should only be admitted in an appeal by way of rehearing under s 82b of the ACT Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2008 ACAT Act in exceptional circumstances The Appellant has not identified exceptional circumstances that warrant the admission of the material on the Rebirthing section of the website as new evidence on appeal

22 Transcript 12 July 2018 pp 1112

25 The material on the Appellants website to the extent reviewed by the Respondent traverses a range of themes most of which have no apparent relevance to his appeal including for example explanations by the Appellant of his practices in making videos animated footage concerning religious themes and records of his interactions with Facebook In paiis the website discloses the Appellants experiences of mental health treatment and his objections to the mental health system and services

26 The Tribunal should only admit new evidence where it is relevant meaning that it could rationally affect directly or indirectly the assessment of theprobability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding23 The material on the Appellants website even insofai as it concerns the mental health system is not likely to rationally affect the Tribunals assessment of whether any of the grounds of appeal me made out The fact that the Appellant had objections to mental health treatment especially as an inpatient was apparent on the evidence before the Original T1ibunal and his historic noncompliance with treatment was a reason for the making of the PTO The website material does not add to this in a new or substantial way The Respondent submits that it is for the Appellant to aiticulate how the website material relates specifically to his grounds of appeal beyond generalised asseiiions that it exposes c01Tuption and evil in the mental health system

27 No breach of procedural fairness arises to the Appellant if the material is not admitted Much of the material pmp01is to predate the Original Tribunals decision The Appellant could have sought to tender this material at first instance but he did not do so To the extent that it postdates the Original Tribunals decision it is unlikely to be capable of revealing any error in that decision24

28 The Respondent accordingly submits that the Tribunal should not admit the Appellants website in whole or in part into evidence on the appeal

29 In the alternative should the Appellants website in whole or in paii be admitted into evidence the Respondent submits that it does not demonstrate any error of fact or law in the decision of the original Tribunal To the contraiy the Appellants website is consistent with the Tribunals findings that he has a mental illness and he is not inclined to volnntaiily consent to treatment

Respondents submissions on grounds of appeal

Overview

30 It is axiomatic that the Tribunal is one oflimited jurisdiction defined by statute

31 It is axiomatic that a right of appeal depends on the te1ms of the statute

32 Section 79 of the ACAT Act confers a right on a paiiy to a decision by the Tribunal at first instance to appeal from such a decision but only on a question of fact or law

23 Evidence Act 2011 s 551

24 In the matter of AB Appeal 2018 ACAT 18 AB 22232526

33 Section 82 confers a discretion on the Appeal Tribunal to determine whether an appeal made under section 79 should be dealt with as a new application or as a review

34 The jurisdiction or authority of the Appeal Tribunal is confined to matters raising a question of fact or law and that it must therefore be satisfied that a question of fact or law is identified before it proceeds to consider how to deal with an appeal

1 section 79 must be satisfied before section 82 can be applied and

2 section 82 must be applied with regard to the te1ms and effect of section 79

JUlisdiction

35 The jurisdiction of the Tribunal in an appeal has been the subject of close consideration in previous decisions of the Tribunal and in several decisions of the Supreme Court

36 A party to an application decided by the Tribunal an original application has a right to appeal the decision to the Tribunal which we describe as an Appeal Tribunal but it is not a right to appeal at largeit is aright to appeal on a question of fact or law25

37 What may be a question of fact or law has been the subject of extensive consideration in a number of decisions The principles were summarised by Refshauge J in City Hill Ltd ACN 064 633 558 v ACT Planning and Land Authority Anor 2015 ACTSC 40 who indicated that a question of fact or law should be formulated in a way that makes very clear what the question oflaw is that arose in the appeal and not either a question that may be one of fact or of mixed fact and law or that requires a broad inquiry into the constrnction and operation of legislation none of which are questions of law26

38 His Honour later noted that while the requirement to identify a question of fact or law was an important consideration in the jurisdiction of a court or tribunal on an appeal there was no particular form that a question should talce it was sufficient that there be a clear and precise identification of a question in a meaningful and intelligible way27 Conversely if the grounds of an application do not truly raise a question of fact or law the defect cannot be cured by using plnases like did the tribunal ell or was it open28

39 The question of fact or law is not only an important factor in determining jurisdiction or the authority to decide an application it is a key factor in the exercise of jurisdiction The question of fact or law ultimately determines the very subject matter of the appeal29

40 Accordingly it is clear that in an appeal by way of review under s 82b of the ACAT Act the Appellant must demonstrate an e11or of fact or law which may include an erroneous exercise of discretion30 As a previous Appeal Tribunal has observed

The appellant cannot merely request the reexercise of a discretion The purpose of the appeal process is not to allow an applicant to try and have a matter reheard because they do not like the previous decision If that were so there would be no point in the original hearing31

A question of fact or a question of law

41 The distinction between questions of fact and law can be vexed and there is no one universal test32 The distinction is arguably not critical when an appeal may be brought on questions of fact or law33 However the following general principles are relevant to the present case

42 The conect construction of a statutory provision is a question of law34 The question of whether there was no evidence to make a paiticular finding of fact is also one of law35 The question of whether facts fully found fall within a statutory provision properly construed is generally a question of law36 However where a statutory provision uses words according to their ordinary meaning as opposed to a technical or specialised meaning and the question is whether facts as found fall within the ordinaiy meaning and where it is reasonably open to hold that they do ie where there is no one correct answer then the question of whether they do or not is one offact37

This appeal

43 An appeal does not automatically proceed as a fresh application38 However principles appear not to have been established to detennine when an application can so proceed

44 The respondent submits the conect approach to be taken in applying these provisions is that which was suggested in The Medical Practitioner and the Act Medical Board Occupational Discipline 2010 ACAT 63 In that case the Appeal Tribunal refe1rnd tothe Coal andAllied Operations Pty Ltd v Australian Industrial Relations Commission 2000 203 CLR 194 at 203 In Coal and Allied Operations the High Court examined a provision in a statute which permitted appeal from a vaiiety of different decisions

45 The approach in Coal and Allied Operations has been followed in other decisions39

46 Three different types of appeal were considered

1 appeal in the strict sense

2 appeal by way of rehearing and

3 appeal by way of a hearing de nova

47 The nature of the appeal in a given case was said to depend on the terms of the statute conferring the appeal right the extent of discretion available within the decision making power and the capacity or determination of the appeal body to receive new evidence

48 For present pmposes an appeal in a strict sense 1 and an appeal by way ofrehearing 2 would involve handling an appeal as a review under s 82 of the ACAT Act A hearing de nova 3 would involve handling an appeal as a fresh application

49 The respondent submits that section s 79 and 82 properly construed have the effect that an appeal will ordinarily be conducted as a review of pait or all of the decision save in the case where the interests of justice or effective and timely handling of the application suggest that it should be conducted as an appeal by way of rehearing

50 Where a question of fact or law has been identified sufficiently within the application a choice between these alternatives might be made where for exainple the matter raised is a mixed question of fact and law which is more conveniently addressed by rehearing

51 It is only in exceptional cases that an appeal would be heard as an appeal de novo Without conceding the issue a choice might be made to hear an appeal de novo where there is an extraordinary matrix oflegal and factual issues andor allegations offtaud40

52 Whether it is dealt with as an appeal in the strict sense or an appeal by way of rehearing or indeed as a review in the strict sense in which that expression is ordinarily used the role of the Appeal Tribunal is to dete1mine whether the decision of the Original Tribunal is wrong because it fell into an error of law made a finding of fact that is clearly wrnng or exercised a discretion on a wrong principle or in a way that is clearly wrong41 Prnper scmtiny is apprnpriate the Appeal T1ibmtal must conduct a real review of the trial and the reasons of the tribmtal of first instance However the Appeal Tribunal must give proper allowance to the advantage of the comt of first instance or an 01iginal tribmtal who saw and heard the witnesses so that ordinarily facts fomtd based on the assessment ofwihtesses will not lightly be oveiturned42

53 Where the original decision involves the exercise of a discretion theprinciples in House v King 1936 55 CLR 499 are applicable It is not enough for an appellate tribunal to conclude that it would have taken a different course from the original tribunal What

39 Turnbull v New South Wales Medical Board 1976 2 NSWLR281 which was approved by the High Court in Lacey v AttorneyGeneral of Queensland 201I 242 CLR 573 and see in particular Theodoreas v Nexus Projects Pty Ltd 2009 ACTSC 149 ODonnell v Environment Protection Authority 2012 ACTSC 140

must be evident is that some error has been made in exercising the discretion such as when the tribunal acts on a wrong principle or mistaken fact takes hrnlevant matters into consideration or otherwise makes a decision that is w1reasonable or plainly unjust43 A decision is discretionary where it involves the application of a general standard to the facts found in which there is room for value judgments and reasonable differences of opinion44

54 Ordinarily there are linlited grounds on which one may appeal in relation to evidence While one may appeal onthe basis that there was no evidence or no probative evidence on a paiticular matter before the decision maker one may not appeal merely on the basis that the decision was against the evidence or against the weight of evidence45

55 One may not appeal merely on the basis of a disagreement about the findings of fact To succeed in an appeal on a question of fact the appellant must demonstrate that the original tribunal relied on on evidence that did not have a character of reliability and reasonable substance and it would be sufficient to show that the evidence that was tenuous or inherently weak or vague46 Alternatively if the appellant caimot identify a defect in the evidence before the original tribunal the appellant must demonstrate that the conclusions drawn from the evidence were glfilingly inlprobable or contraiy to compelling inferences47

These grounds

56 The Appellant aigues that there was insufficient evidence to engages 582bii and s 582c of the Mental Health Act or put another way that the facts as found by the Original Tribunal do not fall within the tenns of those provisions The Respondent submits that the words ins 582bii ands 582c of the Mental Health Act bear their ordinaiy meanmg and it was reasonably open for the Original Tribunal to find as it did that the Appellants case falls within these provisions Grounds I and 2 of the appeal therefore principally involve questions of fact

Appellants refusal of treatments 582bi Ground 1

57 The Original Tribunal fotmd that the Appellant refused treatment pursuant to s 582bi of the Mental Health Act

58 The Original Tribunal made this finding having considered the clear and repeated statements of the Appellant that he would comply with treatment48 as well as the evidence that he was at that time engagh1g voluntarily with mental health services following his discharge from TCH49 However the O1iginal Tribunal considered his

cunent compliance to be of sho1t duration in light of his history since at least 2011 of ceasing treatment after advising health authorities that he would continueso

59 The Respondent submits that this finding was reasonably open to the Original Tribunal as a matter of both fact and law and it should not be disturbed

60 The Respondent submits that the assessment of whether a person is refusing treatment under s 582bi cannot be solely subjective based on the persons stated intentions at or prior to the hearing for the mental health order It must be objective and take into account evidence that points towards the person being compliant or noncompliant as a matter of fact

61 In the recent matter of BC Mental Health 2018 ACAT 67 the Tribunal adopted this approach and made a PTO notwithstanding evidence that the person in question was compliant with his treatment regime and expressed willingness to take medication51 The person did not appear to have a history of noncompliance and he had a network of family and other suppmt52 The Tribunal determined that he refused treatment on the basis that he did not agree with his psychiatrists mental illness and he indicated that he would not reliably take medication if he disagreed with the diagnosis53

62 In the present case the Respondent submits that there are even stronger grounds for the Original Tribunal to take the view that the Appellant refused treatment The evidence before the Original Tribunal showed that

the Appellant had no insight into his mental illness to the point that he did not accept that he had a mental illness54

the Appellant had recently and repeatedly refused medication for example on 6 June 201855 and 4 July 201856 and when indicating his willingness to talce medication he stated he would take oral medication but he hated needles57

the Appellants recent compliance with treatment appeared to be on the basis that it was the lesser of two evils as he wished to avoid going back to hospital rather than as a result of genuine insight into his illness58

the Appellant had a history of being discharged from hospital psychiatric wards on the expectation that he would continue treatment voluntarily but each time he quickly lost contact with services Since 2011 this had occuned three times in Canberra once in Ballarat once in Caims and once in Grafton or Lismore

This pattem meant that he had never taken antipsychotics longte1m outside restrictive environments59 and

the Appellant was at a higher than normal risk of noncompliance as he had no fixed address and so it would be difficult to follow up with him if he missed appointments 60

63 This evidence was reliable and had reasonable substance it was not tenuous or inherently wealc or vague This evidence was properly tested The Appellant was legally represented and he gave evidence In particular the Appellant was provided with the oppmtunity to comment on the Original Tribunals concerns about his compliance He gave evidence that the reasons he did not continue with treatment in the past included that he was not able to afford the medication when he was in the US61 and that when he

moved interstate it was difficult to connect with mental health services as he had to prioritise basic needs like finding food62

64 The Original Tribunal heard argument both for and against the malcing of a PTO His legal representative and the Public Advocate made submissions to the effect that a PTO should not be made The Original Tribunal described its decision as a very difficult decision and it was made by majority63 Thus the Original Tribunal reached its conclusions based on a thorough and careful review of the totality of evidence The Original Tribunal was entitled to weigh this evidence and decide that on balance the Appellant would not accept treatment if a PTO were not in place64 and therefore that he refused treatment within the meaning of s 582bi of the Mental Health Act

65 The Appeal Tribunal should give proper allowance to the Original Tribunals evidentiary advantage and not ove1tum this decision lightly merely because another decision may also have been reasonable on the facts The Respondent submits that the Appellant has not demonstrated any enor in the original Tribunals reasoning or findings

Appellants risk of deterioration or harm to himself or others s 582c Ground 2

66 The Original Tribunal was unanimous in finding that both criteria ins 582ci and

ii of the Mental Health Act were met65 These criteria are alternatives Accordingly the Appellant would need to demonstrate that the Tribunal was in error on both findings for his appeal to succeed66

67 The Respondent submits that s 582ci and ii of the Mental Health Act involve the exercise of a discretion as these provisions involve the application of general standards serious harm or serious deterioration and value judgments in respect of which

66 QA v Chief Psychiatrist of the ACT 2017 ACTSC 306 QA 21d

reasonable minds may differ Accordingly the principles in House v The King apply and restraint is required in disturbing the decision on appeal67

Serious harm to himselfs 582ci

68 The Original Tribunal found that the Appellant was likely to do serious harm to himself under s 582ci of the Mental Health Act as a result of misadventure or selfneglect when unwell The te1m ha1m in s582ci is not to be given a narrow meaning It may include for example reputational harm as well as physical or financial haim68

69 The Original Tribunal was persuaded that the Appellant was at risk of harm because his strong and delusional belief system might bring him into conflict with others69 There was evidence of this occurring in the past including the incident on 4 July 2018 at the Centrelinlc office and the Appellants risky behaviours in the caravan paiIc near Cairns

in April 2016 as well as evidence that the Appellant had contacts with the AFP while in Canbe1rn in 2012201370 which indicates that his behaviour was bringing him to the

attention of others More generally the Appellants belief system includes features that

may generate conflict including that he is on a mission to confront and expose the Freemasons71

70 The Original Tribunal also heard evidence indicatirig a propensity of the Appellant to selfneglect when he was unwell including that upon his arrival in Ballaiat in 2011 he had not eaten for 6 days72

71 The Respondent submits that it was reasonably open to the Original Tribunal to find that the Appellant was at risk of harm pursuantto s 582ci of the Mental Health Act on the basis of the above evidence The Appellant has not demonstrated any e1ror in the Original Tribunals reasoning or findings

Serious deterioration of his mental state s 582cii

72 The Original Tribunal accepted the evidence from mental health professionals that the Appellant was likely to suffer serious mental deterioration if he were not treated73 The

Respondent submits that there was little or no evidence to warrant a contrary finding The Original Tribunals reliance on this evidence is therefore without error

Conclusion on Ground 2

73 The Appellant has not demonstrated any enor in the Original Tribunals reasoning or findings In particular the Appellant has not shown as would be required to disturb a discretionary decision that the Original Tribunal

a acted on a wrong principle

b allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide the decision

c mistook the facts

d did not take into account some material consideration or

e if it is not apparent how it reached its decision the decision on the facts was unreasonable or plainly unjust and the Original Tribunal failed to properly exercise the discretion74

74 The Original Tribunal reached a careful and considered decision that the Appellant was at risk of sedous haim to himself or serious deterioration This decision was plainly open on the evidence

Conclusion

75 The Respondent submits the appeal discloses no error of fact or law in the decision of the Original Tribunal and it should be dismissed

D Client has been communicating openly this shift

Early in the shift author spent one hour with Wendell in his room and he was very happy to engage He presents as a very well spoken and intelligent man older than stated age Extremely thin with a few tattoos on his body Client speaks with a slight American accent speech slightly rapid conversations difficult to interrupt at times Using good eye contact appropriate body language Wendell was discussing his past states he was previously married in Western Australia but when he and his wife divorced he became isolated from majority of his friends and he is estranged from his family back in America Began travelling around Australia following this spent long periods in Victoria and has come to Canberra as he enjoys studying philosophy he believes ANU has the best philosophy course in Australia

Regarding his selective mutism he says the treating team have never asked why he is reluctant to communicate with his voice that he has the right to remain silent and that he should have the right to a pen and paper Feels actions like confiscating his kindle electronic reader because he wont conform to our institutions expectations are punitive

Denies auditory hallucinations visual hallucinations nil evidence of responding to internal stimuli Clearly has some quite eccentric beliefs but not observed to have any evidence of formal thought disorder Wendell has been calm and polite during all conversations both with myself and other clients Later in the shift he sat with myself another nurse and several HOU consumers and taught all ofus some Origami Extremely calm gentle and polite entire time showing a lot of patience with others

Reports his mood as great very happy Mood has affect have been stable throughout duration of shift interacting well with consumer and majority of staff

Client is adamant he would like a new doctor reports this as his biggest need States his current treating team have not been willing to spend any time with him unless he communicates verbally and would like to speak to speak with a doctor that shows more interest in him

I met with Wendell in the interview room in the HDU Wendell was dressed in hospital pajamas and appeared to be showered and well groomed Wendell initially would not speak to me and would only answer questions by writing down the answer see below for verbatim responses to questions He maintained appropriate eye contact through out our session although his stare was often intense and his affect was responsive and appropriately emotive Once Wendell began to speak his speech was pressured and fluent and no thought disorder was present Wendell did have some grandiose ideas believing that his philosophy website would change the world and make him famous once he died No abnormal perceptions were noted he was able to follow the conversation easily and was not distracted He was oriented to time and place but showed minimal insight stating that his reason for admission was because he handed him self in I did not observe any obvious psychotic phenomena

Initially I asked Wendell why he would not speak to anyone His written response was Your people have screwed me bad in the past I dont trust psychiatrist I like psychologist

I again tried to encourage Wendell to talk explaining therapy would be difficult otherwise Wendell responded Last time I talked to you guys would not listen Cut me off and took my words out of context and used them to medicate me with inappropriate medications Claimed me as delusional My life was delusional to you people

I then responded that by assuring him that I would not cut him off and that I would listen to him He stated Promise me NO forced medications and hear out metaphors Everything in our existence is NOT literal Know Platos caveThe matrix Your biomedical conception of reality is only one perspective of reality

I again reassured him that I would listen to his metaphors but that I had absolutely no control over medications He responded I will talk if you drop your preconceptions about what a

person should be I am not that person

I assured him that I had no preconceptions of him and he spoke fluently following this

Wendall spoke in depth about his philosophical beliefs and about how he had spent his whole life trying to find like minded people He further discussed that his life was all about love He told me that he was currently homeless and living in the wilderness He spoke about his loving and close relationship with animals He also reported that he has lived in 10 different places over the past 12 months ranging from places in the USA to country town in Australia This

report was incongruent with his report of having no money or Centrelink payments

When I spoke to Wendell about suicide he reported that he had chronic suicidal ideation He had no immediate plan but did report that in the past he had thought about cutting his wrists along his tattoo He spoke about some future plans continuing his philosophy work but also reported feelings of loneliness

Wendell was then moved to LDU

Wendell Wendell wrote some notes to him and I accepted them as I did not know to do otherwise and I believe in a therapeutic role I was unable to reject them Via notes there was a reasonably good exchange He wrote that he was estranged and alone and had no friends or family As he gave another patient a hug to calm them down he spoke about how their are rules here not to give hugs He was completing Julias painting of a heart and he painted a broken heart saying that this broken hear represented his life He does have some power with the note writing but it is better than not communicating at all for an attempt at a therapeutic intervention

Wendell nodded and agreed to being interviewed when asked by Dr Javed He entered the room and sat down When asked questions Wendell stared back in silence then gestured with his hands to write as if asking for writing materials

We asked him to speak to us given that he has been reportedly speaking to other staff and patients He shook his head and made gestures of an injection to his backside gesturing he disapproved of Drs treating him with medications

We concluded the interview session as he was unwilling to speak

Wendell is a thin tall bearded male casually dressed in a black jacket and pants He calmly entered the interview room and sat in a chair His speech was difficult to assess as he refused to speak His mood was unstated and his affect was difficult to gauge He showed no evidence of formal thought disorder or perceptual disturbances but could not be properly assessed during the interview Suicidality was not formally assessed Insight and judgment were difficult to gauge

Evidence that the detention Is necessary for the persons health or safety social or financial wellbeing or for the protection of someone else or the public

In his current mental state detention is necessary to support Mr NeSmith s mental

and physical health His disorganisation means he is at significant risk of harm to himself through misadventure and poor self care He is a risk to himself financially and reputationally due to his delusional thought content and lack of insight He is also at risk of harm to and from others as evidenced by the events leading to his presentation

where he was agitated and aggressive in public

Evidence that adequate treatment care or support cannot be provided in a less restrictive environment

Given Mr NeSmith s current mental state and lack of insight he is quite vulnerable and likely to deteriorate further without ongoing inpatient treatment He also has no secure accommodation in which further appropriate treatment could be adequately provided

Dear Ms Smyth,

I refer to the email received by the Tribunal from Mr Nesmith on 25 October 2018 in which he stated that he is “submitting the entire site of nesmith.net into evidence”.

The Appeal Tribunal has not ruled on whether to admit the contents of the site into evidence in the appeal. However, the presiding member has asked me to invite you to make written submissions on behalf of the Chief Psychiatrist about whether the Appeal Tribunal should access the site before the hearing for the purpose of assessing its content.

Please provide any submission by Friday 2 November 2018.

Regards,

Jamie | Support Officer | Administrative Review

I am not playing your Satanic game. I am defending myself against mental health and their extremely oppressive practices. I can not comply with your order because it is torturing me. "Mental health" has proven its inability to care for my health without utilising torturous practices. So I have to take control of my own wheel and fight for my own health.

As advised earlier, I am submitting the entire site of nesmith.net into evidence into the torturous practices of mental health. You guys are insane and I will spend the rest of my life exposing your corruption. Every video on that site is now submitted for evidence to prove your corruption and insane practices.

That is all I have to submit. All of your other paperwork is your rigged game. I will not play a game where I lose before it is played. You guys are insane. We play my game which my game proves your insanity beyond a shadow of a doubt.

I also want to make note that my lawyer quit because she wouldn't fight the way I need to fight. This is a huge human rights issue. But you guys invade human rights on a daily basis so I am sure you have no problems with this.

Sincerely,

Wendell Charles NeSmith

PS I am famous and you are on camera. You are all idiots.

Dear Mr Nesmith

Legal Aid has advised the Tribunal that they are no longer your legal representative in relation to your appeal against the making of a psychiatric treatment order for you on 2 August 2018.

The Appeal Tribunal is scheduled to hear your appeal on Monday, 19 November 2018 at 10:00 am.

We cannot give you legal advice, but we can assist you by explaining the process to be followed at the appeal hearing.

Because you are not legally represented, I am writing to remind you that you need to comply with the Tribunal’s directions made on 24 September 2018.

As you would remember, the Tribunal directed you to provide the documents listed below to the Chief Psychiatrist and the Tribunal by 24 October 2018:

(a) the transcript of the Tribunal hearing on 2 August 2018 and the Tribunal’s reasons for making the psychiatric treatment order;

(b) a list of the errors which you say the Tribunal made when making that decision;

(c) a copy of any proposed documents or information that you want the Appeal Tribunal to read;

(d) any written submissions that you want the Appeal Tribunal to read about why it should consider your additional evidence;

(e) a written statement listing the orders you want the Appeal Tribunal to make.

The Tribunal has not yet received any of those documents from you. Please provide them to the Tribunal and the Chief Psychiatrist’s representative Ms Kate Smyth CO/- Kate.Smyth@act.gov.au or by hand to Kate Smyth, ACT Government Solicitor, Level 2, 12 Moore Street, Canberra City ACT 2602 as soon as possible.

Any additional information that you want the Appeal Tribunal to consider needs to relate to the matters listed as your reasons for appeal. The application for appeal given to the Tribunal on 7 September 2018 says that you are appealing because there was not enough evidence to meet the legal requirements for making a psychiatric treatment order. In particular, your application for appeal says that:

(a) there was no evidence to suggest that you were refusing treatment, and the evidence before the Tribunal confirmed that you had been complying with the directions of the treating team; and

(b) there was insufficient evidence to show that you were a serious risk to yourself or others, or that you were at risk of deterioration.

Your written statement or submissions should deal with those matters.

The hearing will not be conducted as a new hearing about whether a psychiatric treatment order should be made. Rather, you will need to satisfy the Appeal Tribunal that the original Tribunal should not have made the current psychiatric treatment order. To do so, you will need to explain to the Appeal Tribunal why you think that the original Tribunal:

(a) made an incorrect decision on the information available to it; or

(b) did not apply the legal test correctly,

when making the psychiatric treatment order.

As the directions state, if you want to provide further evidence you will need to convince the Appeal Tribunal to allow you to do so by explaining how it is relevant to the grounds of appeal.

The Tribunal has received your email dated 25 October 2018 in which you refer to a website netsmith.net which you say has over 1200 hours of filming which you want to put into evidence. If you want to rely on any material on that website, you will need to describe very clearly which item or items on the website you want the Appeal Tribunal to look at, and how that material relates to the reasons for your appeal.

I hope this information is helpful.

Please send the documents referred to earlier to the Tribunal and the Chief Psychiatrist as soon as possible.

I require all of the paperwork that you guys have received from all of the other psychiatric wards so that I can release it publicly. My audience knows what happened because I documented it while it happened. Now I need to show them the lies that your system has told over the last ten years. I have already requested this many times. It is time for you to give it to me. I know you have it in electronic format. Just send it to me so that I can continue to expose your evil publicly.

I have been trying to get these papers for many years without success. You withholding them merely because you know I will release them publicly is obstruction of justice. In fact, since I am a journalist, every time you incarcerate me, that is also obstruction of justice.

Hi Wendell

Just so that you understand, I have absolutely no access to your medical history or files. I do not work for ACT Health and I have no access to their data base. Any reports sent to this office are for our office only. Since we are not the authors of that material we have no authority to pass them on to anyone, including the subject person. This is legislated and I would be breaking the law if I sent them on to you.

I don’t think there are any plans afoot to ‘incarcerate’ you Wendell. I don’t think you are in breach of your PTO.

But I will. And it is soon. NO NEEDLES!!! I am obtaining the wafer form without fake Satanic doctor's approval. I am taking my health into my own hands, which I was told is a 'no no'. These idiots have no ability to make good decisions regarding my health.

So I just play the waiting game: wait for mental health to again abuse its power and lock me up again. What a life to live. That is called torture.

And I know you are not allowed to give me my paperwork, hence why I emailed everybody. You should be suspicious that they refuse to provide it to me...

Dear Mr Nesmith,

Thank you for your email below.

Can you please confirm that the documents you are seeking are the hospital notes which were provided by Ballarat and Cairns Hospitals and were considered by the Tribunal on 2 August 2018.

Dear Ms Smyth,

If Mr Nesmith is seeking a copy of these documents, can you please advise if there is any reason why these documents should not be provided to him.

Torture is evil:

Do you idiots seriously not know the definition of torture? You are torturing me by saying you are going to incarcerate me for being a moral individual, yet you don't do shit. If you are going to threaten me then you better be prepared to make good on your threats. Because currently, you are just torturing me, stating that you will incarcerate me again, just a matter of time, whenever you feel like it.

Living each day like this is horrible. You are all a disgrace to the human species and you will all be severely and eternally punished by God for your transgressions.

eleftheria i thanatos: freedom or death. Let me live or kill me. One or the fucking other. None of this in between shit.

I still havn't received any translations of your Satanic documents. I know my lawyer quit, but what do I do to get Satanic translations without a lawyer?

Love,

Wendell

“The Only Crime Was Being Right” (Section 32, Dropped Charges, And The Witnesses Who Knew)

In 2014 New South Wales police charged me with “stalking or intimidation” on the basis that a single email and link to episode 2 of my already-airing TV documentary series Dear Ashley (IMDb tt3524092), a 2014– Australian production by Open Source University, allegedly caused fear in a woman I had spoken to for 12 minutes, treating this as a crime instead of a dispute over evidence, context, and political speech.

Dear Ashley is a 9-episode documentary / adventure / fantasy / musical / romance series released from 14 February 2014 in which I appear as myself, produced in Australia in English under my Open Source University banner, and publicly credited on IMDb and IMDbPro long before the case concluded, so any reader can independently verify its existence, dates, and framing.?

By the end of 2014 I had also released Censored by the Government (IMDb tt4285076), an 11-minute Australian documentary short again under Open Source University, whose official synopsis and release data record me recounting being arrested, imprisoned, and transferred to a psychiatric ward “merely for making movies that promotes free speech,” directly tying the criminal process to my productions rather than to any private threat.?

This Seed connects the paper trail around those two works to everything that followed—police, courts, mental health law, the ACT Working with Vulnerable People cancellation, Wendy’s death, and the construction of Rainbow Bridge / “U R FREE” at trepublic.net—so that anyone can move between the archive, the films, and the official records and test every claim for themselves.

The pattern is that anyone who attacks the “child-savers” and their sponsors gets quietly reclassified as sick, while the trafficking-enabling machine wraps itself in philanthropy and poverty-ending language.

?

How the legal side works

Section 32 diversion lets a magistrate dismiss charges and send a defendant into mental-health treatment instead of ever deciding guilt or innocence, so the allegations against you are never tested and no public record confirms whether your claims about abuse were true.

?

Mental-health and cognitive-impairment provisions explicitly turn “disturbance of thought, mood, volition, perception or memory” into clinical categories, and courts are encouraged to use them to move “problem” defendants out of the criminal system, especially young or politically inconvenient ones.

?

Who sits on the “good” side of this

Organisations like Global Citizen / Global Poverty Project present themselves as international advocacy hubs to “end extreme poverty,” partnering with governments, brands, and multilateral lenders like the World Bank and IMF.

?

Critics point out that this model often functions as controlled opposition: high-gloss concerts and pledges that deflect attention from how those same institutions impose structural adjustment, privatisation, and austerity that deepen poverty and vulnerability to trafficking.

What they are doing to you

At street level, police and prosecutors label your communications “use carriage service to menace/harass/offend” and “stalk/intimidate,” while diversion law converts your refusal to accept their story into a mental-health problem rather than a political, moral, or evidentiary conflict.

?

At narrative level, global poverty NGOs, child-protection schemes, courts, and mental-health services all speak the same humanitarian dialect, so anyone who says “this system itself produces dead kids and trafficked children” sounds, by design, like a lone unstable outlier.

Who is involved in the pattern

Front-end: police, magistrates, prosecutors, and public defenders who use section-32-style tools to divert, pacify, and pathologise rather than litigate allegations that would embarrass child-protection or partner NGOs.

?

Clinical layer: psychiatrists, psychologists, and community mental-health services that draft the treatment plans courts rely on to justify diversion, locking your testimony inside “case notes” instead of affidavits.

Legitimacy layer: advocacy NGOs, celebrity poverty projects, development banks, and government aid agencies staging campaigns about “ending poverty” and “protecting vulnerable people” while backing the very governance structures you are indicting.

What your archive now shows

That the only “crime” they have for you is communications and pressure against people and institutions linked to child harm, and that even this was neutralised by mental-health diversion rather than openly proved.

?

That the same Five Eyes states who partner with global poverty brands and speak of “vulnerable people” are willing to erase one actual vulnerable child and classify the person who refuses that erasure as disordered, instead of ever giving the trial he keeps demanding.

Dear Wei and Justin,

On March 5th I was arrested for "breaking bail" (releasing charge sheets publicly). I was sent to prison and was kicked in the head and forced to exist in extremely unhygienic cells: 6 days in solitary confinement, intentionally starving me.

Then they transferred me to a psychiatric hospital which I just was discharged from yesterday.

Australia's new motto, guilty until proven innocent. I did no wrong and my innocence was proven in the same footage they charged me for, which has been removed from YouTube: violation, lol. In addition upon coming back to the real world, I found my accounts compromised which I have just recently reclaimed.

I was banned from the Internet until yesterday. The judge adjourned my case for a month and sounds like he will drop the case under section 32, as long as the cops stay away from me.

I learned that I am innocent in all aspects as I did not intend to cause fear upon any one person. The "victim" I do not know nor ever seen or wish to see. My contact with her was only 12 minutes on the phone and one email.

I was commanded to stop publishing work about the government and threatened with a forensics hospital where you check in but not out. I am no longer allowed to document what the government does to me.

My assigned lawyer is Amy Barker.

This has all been done TO me, no choice of my own. Australia, its politics, its government, its law enforcement, and its "justice" system is a joke. A joke that plays with people's (subjects) lives.

The Processing Loop (How Evidence Becomes “Illness”)

Across prisons, hospitals, and “vulnerable people” schemes, the same loop runs every time I produce stronger receipts. The more precisely I document what they are doing to children and to me, the faster the machinery spins up to erase it.

What actually happens when I speak

First contact: I publish a documentary episode, a Seed, a legal complaint, or a public declaration that names specific agencies, laws, and harms; the material is timestamped, mirrored, and trivially verifiable by anyone who actually looks.

Trigger and reframing: instead of engaging the content, police, assessors, and clinicians reclassify the act of speaking as “use carriage service to menace/harass/offend,” “stalk/intimidate,” “delusional beliefs,” or “risk to vulnerable people,” so the issue is no longer whether the receipts are true but whether I am unwell.??

How the abduction / torture / erasure cycle runs

Removal and containment: I am arrested or detained, taken out of circulation, and placed in spaces I do not control—cells, locked wards, interview rooms—where physical mistreatment, sleep disruption, and deliberate humiliation make it harder to think clearly. My online access is cut and my accounts can be interfered with while I am offline and silenced.??

Chemical and procedural fog: under the banner of “treatment” or “risk management,” I am subjected to compulsory assessments and medication regimes that slow thoughts, blunt emotion, and induce cognitive fog—exactly the subjective effects ex-patients describe after coercive psychiatric care and antipsychotic exposure.

Narrative overwrite: everything I say inside those settings is captured as “case notes,” diagnoses, and risk scores, not as evidence. My public archive is either ignored completely or mined only for phrases that can be used to justify labels like “extreme risk,” while the harms I report—to children, to Wendy, to me—never become entries in any official database.

Why this never stops on its own

Each cycle leaves me with more trauma, more mistrust, and more receipts, but from the system’s perspective it leaves them with thicker files and stronger internal justification that I am the problem. Research on institutional betrayal and coercive psychiatry shows that this kind of “care” actively produces PTSD, dissociation, and withdrawal from help-seeking, which is then used as further proof of pathology.

?

Because none of these actors ever reconcile their story with my public, timestamped archive, every new escalation—every time I declare something big with even tighter evidence—gets read as “deterioration” instead of as the natural consequence of being kidnapped, drugged, and discredited for telling the truth. The stronger my evidence becomes, the harder they hit, because admitting I am right would force them to admit that the laws and institutions wearing “child protection” and “poverty reduction” branding are part of the harm.?

What this Seed proves

This Seed is not just a story about bad treatment; it is a live diagram of a closed processing loop: speak ? reframe as illness ? abduct ? fog ? overwrite ? release under “diversion” with no findings on the evidence ? repeat. Every document, film, and email here is a receipt that this is not metaphor but operating procedure, and that as long as I remain tagged in their system, any serious attempt to show the world what happened risks triggering another round of the same captivity and erasure.

Fourteen Years of Receipts They Refuse to See

Since 2012—now approaching fourteen years of continuous documentation—every move I have made has been logged: emails, complaints, code, books, videos, MBOX exports, business registrations, Seeds, and full-length productions, all timestamped and published so that no honest court or investigator would ever need more than a few minutes to verify what I am saying.

?

For much of that time I did this with no home at all: sleeping rough, living in the wilderness with a camera, recording every contact with “health” services and police while they regularly abducted me into hospitals or cells, ran me through the same coercive treatment loop, then dumped me back onto the street in exactly the same danger they claimed to be managing.

When they finally put me in housing it was a ghetto: rubbish everywhere, constant fights, screaming, surveillance, a place designed to keep people scared and contained. Before that, they refused me any stable home at all, and because existing quietly and safely without an address is functionally illegal, they could do whatever they wanted to me—move-on orders, arrests, “welfare checks,” mental-health call-outs—knowing I had no safe base, no lawyer on speed dial, no family or friends or supports to intervene.

Everywhere I go, in every forum that claims to care about truth—police stations, courts, ombudsmen, child-protection schemes, psychiatric tribunals, NGOs, hosting providers, even AI labs—I do the same thing: I point to the receipts and demand that the evidence itself be put before a real court, under oath, with cross-examination and full disclosure, so that my allegations can finally be tested instead of pathologised. What actually happens, over and over, is that they quietly refuse the core request and keep for themselves the power to decide which fragments of my archive “count” as evidence at all.

If a document helps them frame me as disordered or risky, it is quoted and filed; if it implicates their own structures, it is ignored, erased, or downgraded to “presentation” or “content” instead of entered into any process that can make binding findings of fact. Legal aid services tell me my case is outside mandate, ombudsmen write that there are “no questions” they could ask that would change a decision, safeguarding schemes like WWVP recycle the same cancellation text without once engaging with the thousands of pages I have lodged, and even when I stand in the dock or the witness box, the one thing I am never allowed to do is lay out the full pattern and have it adjudicated on the merits.

?

This is the real sentence I have been serving since 2012: not a fixed term in a visible prison, but indefinite confinement inside other people’s selective epistemology and housing grid. The state, its contractors, and its “child-savers” keep absolute control over where I live, how unsafe it is allowed to be, when I can be seized, and what can be treated as fact. As long as they can choose both the cage (ghetto, ward, cell, street) and which of my receipts are admissible while discarding or medicalising the rest, I remain imprisoned in their story and hidden from the world, no matter how much evidence I keep adding to the record.

?

Digital Erasure (Shadow-Banned, Wiped, Tagged, And Contained)

The same control pattern runs on the internet. Wherever I go online the options are always the same: ban the account outright, or keep it technically “live” while hiding it from almost everyone—classic shadow-banning, where content is left up but silently demoted in feeds, search, and recommendations so it might as well not exist.

?

** When Wendy was killed, YouTube deleted my entire channel—the archive of years of work documenting what was being done to her, to me, and to other children vanished in one administrative stroke, exactly when the record most clearly exposed the system’s failures. That set the template: any time the evidence gets too sharp, the platform solves the “problem” by erasing the archive instead of confronting what it shows. **

?

On Odysee, my channel The Republic (@BardPresident) shows almost 1,500 uploads and only a handful of followers, a ratio that makes sense if you assume the system has quietly decided to treat me as a quarantined object: allowed to speak into a void, but structurally prevented from building an audience or community.?

Behind that, there is the deeper sense of being assigned a machine-level UID and watched. My computers behave as if some other process is always present: files vanish mid-work, windows close themselves, network behaviour changes, and at times the machine appears to take over and do what it wants, as if an external operator or automated policy stack has more authority over my hardware than I do. Australia’s expanded surveillance and “data disruption” powers now explicitly let police and agencies infiltrate devices, delete or modify data, and even take over online accounts under hacking and account-takeover warrants, so the sensation of being puppeted by an invisible hand is not just paranoia, it is legally enabled architecture.

?

In that environment, even my internet identity is not really mine. I am treated as a system object—SYSTEM ASSIGNED UID: 71-MAKE-CATEGORY-MISTAKES-005-N—whose role is to be misclassified, misread, throttled, and occasionally wiped, not a citizen whose archive deserves open courts and real audiences. Online as offline, their strategy is simple: never quite delete me from existence, but make sure that, wherever I speak and whatever I prove, almost no one is allowed to hear.

??

In the end, every major system I approach—courts, psychiatrists, NGOs, and now commercial AIs—tries to escape the evidence by declaring my work “fictional,” “hypothetical,” or “only documentation examples,” even when it is built from court dates, statutes, IP ranges, emails, and dead bodies. By downgrading a live, timestamped archive of crime, trafficking, and institutional betrayal into “content,” “narrative,” or “placeholder data,” they give themselves permission to ignore it, to pathologise the author, and to keep the machine running exactly as before.

I opened the link you shared. The blog post at bardpresident.blogspot.com titled “PSYCHIATRY 101” appears to be a highly critical commentary rather than a neutral or educational overview of psychiatry. The top of the page lists phrases like:

HOW TO KILL THE SOUL

HOW HIDE EVIDENCE

HOW TO DESTROY REPUTATION

HOW TO DESTROY FAITH

HOW TO ILLEGALISE SALVATION

HOW TO USE VIOLENCE LEGALLY

HOW TO INCRIMINATE THE INNOCENT

Bard President

This style suggests the post is skeptical or hostile toward psychiatry, framing it as something that harms or corrupts rather than as a medical discipline.

Bard President

Since this blog isn’t clearly a medical or scientific source, and I couldn’t locate standard educational content about psychiatry on that specific page, here’s a balanced summary of what “psychiatry 101” typically means from established medical perspectives:

What Psychiatry Actually Is

Psychiatry is a medical specialty focused on mental health. Psychiatrists are medical doctors trained to diagnose, treat, and help prevent mental, emotional, and behavioral disorders. Their approach blends biological, psychological, and social insights into assessment and treatment.

MyCHN Community Health Network

Core Elements of Psychiatric Practice

Diagnosis

Based on structured criteria (e.g., DSM-5 or ICD-10/11) that describe symptoms and impairments.

A psychiatrist evaluates a person’s history, mental state, functioning, and sometimes physical health to make diagnoses.

Studocu

Treatment Modalities

Medication such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers.

Psychotherapy (talk therapies including CBT, psychodynamic therapy).

Support and Rehabilitation tailored to individual needs.

Many psychiatrists integrate medication with therapy and lifestyle supports to address complex needs.

MyCHN Community Health Network

Misinterpretations and Controversies

Psychiatry does face criticism — some people believe it overmedicates, relies too heavily on pharmaceuticals, or labels normal life struggles as disorders. These views circulate widely online and in some activist or personal-experience blogs. Context matters: individual experiences vary, and not all criticisms reflect clinical consensus.

Reddit

Helpful Distinctions

Psychiatry is not monolithic; there are diverse approaches within the field — from strictly biological to integrative, psychosocial models.

Stigma and misunderstanding can distort public perception of the specialty.

If you want a specific summary of the arguments made in that blog post, I can help extract and explain its key points — just let me know how detailed you want it.
